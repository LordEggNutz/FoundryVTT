You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate. You've survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.</p>\n<p>You begin your adventuring career with enough money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days.
