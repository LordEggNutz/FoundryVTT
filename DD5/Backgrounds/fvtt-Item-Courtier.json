You might or might not come from an upper-class family; your talents, rather than the circumstances of your birth, could have secured you this position.</p>\n<p>You might have been one of the many functionaries, attendants, and other hangers-on in the Court of Silverymoon, or perhaps you traveled in Waterdeep's baroque and sometimes cutthroat conglomeration of guilds, nobles, adventurers, and secret societies. You might have been one of the behind-the-scenes law-keepers or functionaries in Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter, or you might have grown up in and around the castle of Daggerford.</p>\n<p>Even if you are no longer a full-fledged member of the group that gave you your start in life, your relationships with your former fellows can be an advantage for you and your adventuring comrades. You might undertake missions with your new companions that further the interest of the organization that gave you your start in life. In any event, the abilities that you honed while serving as a courtier will stand you in good stead as an adventurer.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Skill Proficiencies:</span> Insight, Persuasion</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Languages:</span> Any two of your choice</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Equipment:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A set of fine clothes</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A pouch containing 5 den</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><hr /></div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"103\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Feature: Court Functionary</span></span>\n<p>Your knowledge of how bureaucracies function lets you gain access to the records and inner workings of any noble court or government you encounter.
