You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric&mdash;performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.</p>\n<p>Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Skill Proficiencies:</span> Insight, Religion</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Languages:</span> Two of your choice</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Equipment:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A holy symbol (perhaps a gift to you when you entered the priesthood)</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A prayer book or prayer wheel</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>5 sticks of incense</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A set of vestments</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A set of common clothes</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A belt pouch containing 15 den</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><hr /></div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"83\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Feature: Shelter of the Faithful</span></span>\n<p>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity.
