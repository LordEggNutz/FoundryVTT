People scoff at its value and call it junk, relics of the past to be forgotten. They are wrong. You are one of the few who stand against that ignorance. You keep those records and artifacts. You see the value of them, as well as what history and significance they possess. You may even know their value where others sneer at a bit of wear and tear. Time destroys, but it makes things all the more valuable to have and remember. Perhaps you are called a packrat, but let them. You have to yourself, a trove of treasures from times when no one remembers.</p>\n<p>Meticulousness runs in their profession, though some are more slovenly in their upkeep while others are very pristine. Usually, they are aware of everything in their archives and are very knowledgeable in their area of archiving. They are not totally driven to adventure, but some who have an eye for value will be willing to bargain anything to obtain a certain entry for their archives. Some do answer the call to travel to pursue long-lost treasures that resurface in alluring legends. Those who are passionate, and even some are not, can spin tales of regaling history, hoping to instill their zeal in others.</p>\n<p>When making a character of this background, consider their motivation for entering this odd hobby. Is it even a hobby? Perhaps it is your life&rsquo;s work and passion. Are you hired by a kingdom to work and maintain royal archives? Do you enjoy showing off these timeless collections, or do you prefer to be miserly and keep everything to yourself? Are you intent in inspiring others with your knowledge? Or perhaps are you more content to bury your nose in your studies? Archivists tend to be mainly lawful or neutral, bound by some sense of self-duty or their job. However, there are many undertones to their work which can take even sinister forms.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Skill Proficiencies:</span> History, Performance</li>\n<li><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Tool Proficiencies:</span> A musical instrument of your choice</li>\n<li><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Languages:</span> One exotic language of your choice</li>\n<li><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Equipment:</span>\n<ul>\n<li>A musical instrument of your choice</li>\n<li>A set of traveler&rsquo;s clothes</li>\n<li>A leather-bound journal in which you record the events you witness</li>\n<li>An ink bottle</li>\n<li>A quill</li>\n<li>A belt pouch containing 5 den.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><hr /></div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"84\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Archivist Type</span></span>\n<table class=\" stripe-odd-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col-1 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d6]]</th>\n<th class=\"col-11\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Specialization</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-1 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\">1</td>\n<td class=\"col-11\">Ancient Scripture</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-1 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"2\" data-roll-max=\"2\">2</td>\n<td class=\"col-11\">Art</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-1 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"3\" data-roll-max=\"3\">3</td>\n<td class=\"col-11\">Geological Discovery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-1 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"4\" data-roll-max=\"4\">4</td>\n<td class=\"col-11\">Biographical Recreation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-1 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"5\" data-roll-max=\"5\">5</td>\n<td class=\"col-11\">National Treasure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-1 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"6\" data-roll-max=\"6\">6</td>\n<td class=\"col-11\">Historical Trinkets</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><hr /></div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"83\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Feature: Historical Value</span></span>\n<p>Since you are so well-versed in monitoring the artifacts and such of great value, you are able to plainly see value across time.
