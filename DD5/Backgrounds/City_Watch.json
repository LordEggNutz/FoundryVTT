You aren't a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible enemies. Instead, your service to your hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe.</p>\n<p>You might have been part of the City Watch of Waterdeep, the baton-wielding police force of the City of Splendors, protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy nobility alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant defenders of Silverymoon, a member of the Silverwatch or even one of the magic-wielding Spellguard.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you hail from Neverwinter and have served as one of its Wintershield watchmen, the newly founded branch of guards who vow to keep safe the City of Skilled Hands.</p>\n<p>Even if you're not city-born or city-bred, this background can describe your early years as a member of law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have their own constables and police forces, and even smaller communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready to protect their community.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Skill Proficiencies:</span> Athletics, Insight</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Languages:</span> Any two of your choice</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Equipment:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A uniform in the style of your unit and indicative of your rank</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A horn with which to summon help</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A set of manacles</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A pouch containing 10 den</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><hr /></div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"97\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Feature: Watcher's Eye</span></span>\n<p>Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals.
