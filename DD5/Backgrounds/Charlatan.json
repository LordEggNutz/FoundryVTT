You know what makes them tick, you can tease out their hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read like they were children's books. It's a useful talent, and one that you're perfectly willing to use for your advantage</p>\n<p>You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise to deliver. Common sense should steer people away from things that sound too good to be true, but common sense seems to be in short supply when you're around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will surely cure that unseemly rash, this ointment&ndash;nothing more than a bit of fat with a sprinkle of silver dust&ndash;can restore youth and vigor, and there's a bridge in the city that just happens to be for sale. These marvels sound implausible, but you can make them sound like the real deal.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Skill Proficiencies:</span> Deception, Sleight of Hand</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Tool Proficiencies:</span> Disguise kit, Forgery kit</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Equipment:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A set of fine clothes</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A disguise kit</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>Tools of the con of your choice:</p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>Ten stoppered bottles filled with colored liquid</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A set of weighted dice</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A deck of marked cards</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A signet ring (of an imaginary duke)</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A belt pouch containing 15 den</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><hr /></div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"94\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Feature: False Identity</span></span>\n<p>You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona.
