For years you labored under a dwarf master of the craft, enduring long hours and dismissive, sour-tempered treatment in order to gain the fine skills you possess today.</p>\n<p>You are most likely a dwarf, but not necessarily&mdash;particularly in the North, the shield dwarf clans learned long ago that only proud fools who are more concerned for their egos than their craft turn away promising apprentices, even those of other races. If you aren't a dwarf, however, you have taken a solemn oath never to take on an apprentice in the craft: it is not for nondwarves to pass on the skills of Moradin's favored children. You would have no difficulty, however, finding a dwarf master who was willing to receive potential apprentices who came with your recommendation.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Skill Proficiencies:</span> History, Insight</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Tool Proficiencies:</span> One type of artisan's tools</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Languages:</span> Dwarvish or one of your choice if you already speak Dwarvish</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Equipment:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A set of artisan's tools with which you are proficient</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A maker's mark chisel used to mark your handiwork with the symbol of the clan of crafters you learned your skill from</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A set of traveler's clothes</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A pouch containing 5 den</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A gem worth 10 den</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><hr /></div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"99\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Feature: Respect of the Stout Folk</span></span>\n<p>As well respected as clan crafters are among outsiders, no one esteems them quite so highly as dwarves do.
