Was it a merchant ship, a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship? How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it widely traveled? Is it still sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost with all hands?</p>\n<p>What were your duties on board&ndash;boatswain, captain, navigator, cook, or some other position? Who were the captain and first mate?
