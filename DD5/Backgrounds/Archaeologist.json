People scoff at its value and call it junk, relics of the past to be forgotten. They are wrong. You are one of the few who stand against that ignorance. You keep those records and artifacts. You see the value of them, as well as what history and significance they possess. You may even know their value where others sneer at a bit of wear and tear. Time destroys, but it makes things all the more valuable to have and remember. Perhaps you are called a packrat, but let them. You have to yourself, a trove of treasures from times when no one remembers.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Skill Proficiencies:</span> History, Survival</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Tool Proficiencies:</span> Cartographer's tools or navigator's tools</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Languages:</span> One of your choice</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Equipment:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A wooden case containing a map to a ruin or dungeon</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A bullseye lantern</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A miner's pick</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A set of traveler's clothes</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A shovel</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A two-person tent</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A trinket recovered from a dig site</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A pouch containing 25 den</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><hr /></div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"88\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dust Digger</span></span>\n<p>Prior to becoming an adventurer, you spent most of your young life crawling around in the dust, pilfering relics of questionable value from crypts and ruins.
