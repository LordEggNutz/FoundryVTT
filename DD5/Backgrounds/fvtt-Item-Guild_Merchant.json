You don't craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works of others (or the raw materials artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop. In some ways, the traveling merchant's life lends itself to adventure far more than the life of an artisan.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Skill Proficiencies:</span> Insight, Persuasion</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Tool Proficiencies:</span> One type of artisan's tools, or navigator's tools, or an additional language</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Languages:</span> One of your choice</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">Equipment:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice) or a mule and cart</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A letter of introduction from your guild</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A set of traveler's clothes</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p>A belt pouch containing 15 den</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><hr /></div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"155\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Feature: Guild Membership</span></span>\n<p>As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides.
