Meant as an introduction to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, this campaign runs hand-in-hand with the <a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules\"><em>Player's Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rules</em></a>, which is available completely free from WotC's website. You can download your own copy of the PDF <a href=\"https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules\">HERE</a>.<br><br>For your convenience, this campaign's handouts list page and chapter numbers from the above PDF so you and your players can refer back to specific rules mentioned throughout this adventure.<br><br><h4>Dynamic Lighting</h4>All of the floor maps provided for this adventure has <a href=\"https://wiki.roll20.net/Dynamic_Lighting\">Dynamic Lighting</a> enabled. This is an advanced feature available to only <strong>Plus</strong> &amp; <strong>Pro</strong> Roll20 Users. If you are a Base Subscriber, you can still hide areas of your floor map by using the <a href=\"https://wiki.roll20.net/Fog_of_War\">Fog of War Tool</a>.<br><br>The Elf Wizard and Dwarf Cleric tokens have been set up at default to have Darkvision range for vision. Both Human Fighters and the Halfling Rogue tokens are currently all set to be holding a torch. You'll want to adjust the light radius on those tokens as you discern who's holding a torch during adventuring.

You're also welcome to incorporate whatever tokens your players would like to use for their characters. Token permissions are tied to their respective character sheets.<br><br>If you're new to Roll20, we recommend copying and pasting player tokens from one map to the next instead of dragging them out from the Journal. This will make it possible to retain the chosen portraits for each PC. <br><br>If you're well familiar with Roll20, once players have chosen their desired portrait and renamed their tokens, you can re-link them to their character sheets. This retains the chosen side of the token and makes dragging the journal entries possible. </span><br><hr><h3>Adventure Backstory </h3>Over five hundred years ago, a pact was made between a clan of gnomes and dwarves which became known as the Phandelver Pact. Together they mined the magically rich ores within Wave Echo Cave. Human spellcasters from nearby Phandalin joined forces with them and together they combined their collective skills to create a forge to craft magical items dubbed the Forge of Spells. Everything came to an abrupt end when orcs, craving magical treasures, sieged Phandalin and the Wave Echo Cave mine. The battle destroyed Phandalin and much of the mine as well, causing various cave-ins throughout. Very few survived the conflict to relate the tale. The Forge of Spells become legend and the entrance to Wave Echo Cave was lost.<br><br>Flash-forward to present day, th<span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\">e Rockseeker brothers, </span>intent in finding and reopening this now-fabled mine, manage to locate the cave. Their activity was never a secret. A nefarious villain known as Nezznar the Black Spider, a drow wizard, has been watching and waiting for the dwarves to uncover this location. The drow desires to harness the Forge of Spells for his own purposes and has rallied bandit gangs and goblin tribes from within the region to aid him in this mission. The party's questing within the Sword Coast region will have them square off with various underlings of Nezznar's and eventually the drow himself if they choose to pursue him straight into the Wave Echo Cave.<br><br><h3>Act 1: Goblin Arrows <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-Xz333xLilFpdgjbn\">Overview Link</a></h3><strong>Summary:</strong> The party is sent off to the town of Phandalin and along the way, they encounter the destroyed remains of a trader's wagon. While investigating, goblins ambush the party. If the party chooses to track the goblins into the woods they will find a cave that is a hideout for the Cragmaw goblin tribe. If they're quick-witted, the party can save Sildar Hallwinter, a human warrior who was aboard the previously assaulted wagon. The other member who was on that wagon, a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker, has been taken away elsewhere. The party continues on to Phandalin.<br><br><strong>Maps Used:</strong> <br><ul><li>Sword Coast Map</li><li>Cragmaw Hideout<br></li></ul><br><h3>Act 2: Phandalin <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-XtdpvoGSfUQPRn87\">Overview Link</a></h3><strong>Summary:</strong> The town of Phandalin is a ramshackle village built around the remains and foundations of the previous settlement destroyed by an orc warband hundreds of years previous. The party can learn more about <span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\">Gundren and</span> his two brothers, Tharden and Nundro Rockseeker. All three have recently mysteriously vanished since making the claim that they had located an entrance to the legen<span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\">dary Wave Echo Cave. T</span>hings are clearly amiss in town when the party arrives. The denizens of Phandalin are being terrorized by a gang of bandits dubbed The Redbrands, named as such for the scarlet cloaks they all wear. The party can accept several side quests around town and enquire about the Rockseeker brothers. Eventually, their activity attracts the attention of the Redbrands who are keen on either running the party out of town or killing them outright. The party is forced to handle the Redbrands in order to remain in Phandalin, which leads them to infiltrating the Redbrand Hideout and sussing out their leader, the charismatic Glasstaff, to put an end to the bandit gang. <br><br><strong>Maps Used:</strong><br><ul><li>3: Phandalin</li><li>4: Redbrand Hideout</li></ul><br><h3>Act 3: The Spider's Web <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-Y4QCn2TkoI8ca84l\">Overview Link</a></h3><strong>Summary:</strong> In this arc of the campaign, the players can participate in any or <em>all</em> of the side quests given out by various villagers of Phandalin. Each side quest will task the party to venture out into the surrounding forests of the Sword Coast region to explore a specific location.The only side quest that is essential to this act in the campaign is Cragmaw Castle. All other side quests can be completed either during this act OR after this campaign is over to lead onto new adventures.<br>Hints on the whereabouts of Gundren Rockseeker lead the party to Cragmaw Castle, an old fort reclaimed by the Cragmaw goblin tribe. Gundren is being held prisoner here and can be freed after defeating the Cragmaw's leader King Grol and his wolf companion, Snarl. Fearful for the safety of his siblings, Gundren is eager to lead the party to the Wave Echo Cave. <br><br><strong>Maps Used:</strong><br><ul><li>Sword Coast Map</li><li>Ruins of Thundertree (optional side quest)</li><li>5: Cragmaw Castle</li></ul><br><h3>Act 4: Wave Echo Cave <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-Y9zAwENv4MRdag-T\">Overview Link</a></h3><strong>Summary:</strong> It is clear now that all the goblins and bandits wreaking havoc in the area are taking orders from someone calling themself the Black Spider. This mystery villain is intent on making sure the location to Wave Echo Cave is kept secret and is the reason why the dwarven siblings were kidnapped. The party ventures into Wave Echo Cave to find the other two Rockseeker brothers. They'll need to defeat various monsters and face off with Nezznar The Black Spider, but their efforts will be rewarded with lost treasures and the Forge of Spellsitself! Completing Wave Echo Cave is the end of the <em>Lost Mine of Phandelver</em> campaign of the D&amp;D 5e Starter Set, but it leaves many loose threads dangling for a Dungeon Master to tug on to create new adventures for their players. <br><br><strong>Maps Used:</strong><br><ul><li>6: Wave Echo Cave</li></ul>",

            "notes": "<h3>1. Arriving in Phandalin</h3>The frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver’s Pact. However, the same orc horde that sacked the mines at Wave Echo Cave laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.<br><br>In the last three or four years, hardy settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. A bustling frontier settlement has grown up on the site of the old town, and is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Unfortunately, more than a few bandits and brigands have settled here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local lord or authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has controlled Phandalin for the past two months, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk as Glasstaff.<br><br>When the characters first arrive in Phandalin, read:<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>The rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, and you catch your first glimpse of Phandalin. The town consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings, some built on old fieldstone foundations. More old ruins—crumbling stone walls covered in ivy and briars—surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this must have been a much larger town in centuries past. Most of the newer buildings are set on the sides of the cart track, which widens into a muddy main street of sorts as it climbs toward a ruined manor house on a hillside at the east side of town.</em></div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>As you approach, you see children playing on the town green and townsfolk tending to chores or running errands at shops. Many people look up as you approach, but all return to their business as you go by.</em></div>If <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzPYLw3mbAXpmqJTjA\">Sildar Hallwinter</a> is with the party, add:<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>Sildar seems much more at ease.<br>“My friends,” he says, “let us secure lodgings. I’m told the local inn is very quaint.”</em></div>Sildar’s plan is to get some rest at the Stonehill Inn, then search Phandalin for signs of the missing wizard, Iarno Albrek. When his investigation hits a dead end, he sets up a meeting with Townmaster <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VecoxP4-IzGMDAbc\">Harbin Wester</a> (see the “Townmaster’s Hall” section of <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw3NnvK12yxqbNF0WtF\">Phandalin Locations</a>).<br><br>During this part of the adventure, the characters can visit the various locations in Phandalin and talk to the NPCs there. (See <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw3NnvK12yxqbNF0WtF\">Phandalin Locations</a> handout for details.) The town is small enough that it takes only a few minutes to stroll from one end to the other. However, the characters arrive late in the day and can’t get to more than one or two locations before it’s time to seek lodgings for the night.<br><br>Some locales the characters should visit include the following:<br><br><ul><li><strong><em>Barthen’s Provisions:</em></strong> If the characters have the wagonload of supplies from Gundren's adventure hook, they are meant to deliver it to this shop.</li></ul><ul><li><strong><em>Lionshield Coster:</em></strong> If the characters retrieved the stolen goods from the Cragmaw hideout, they might want to return them to the rightful owner.</li></ul><ul><li><strong><em>Stonehill Inn:</em></strong> If the characters have Sildar Hallwinter with them, the knight suggests heading for this inn to find lodgings. If the characters are otherwise looking for a place to eat and sleep, they discover that the Stonehill appears to be the best available option.</li></ul><hr><h3>2. Tasks in Phandalin</h3>When the characters explore Phandalin, you don’t need to keep track of how much time is spent at each location. Instead, imagine that you’re directing an old-style western movie. Your goal is to present several scenes in which the adventurers walk into a store or saloon and meet the people there. By interacting with these NPCs, the adventurers learn what the NPCs need or what information they want to share, then can move on to the next location. These scenes are a series of roleplaying encounters that take place over the course of a couple of days of game time.<br><br>To begin, ask the players where they want to go and what they want to do in town. For example, you could tell them, “There’s an inn, a town hall, a shrine, general stores and trading posts, and a few other homes and businesses. Where do you want to go?” When the players pick a spot, refer to the description in <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw3NnvK12yxqbNF0WtF\">Phandalin Locations</a> handout, introduce the NPCs there, and let the interaction begin.<br><br><strong><em>The Stonehill Inn:</em></strong> If the players aren’t sure what their characters should do, encourage them to begin at the Stonehill Inn. The NPCs there are “pointers” who can direct the characters toward the various adventure opportunities and important rumors that can be found in other parts of the town. By visiting the inn, the characters learn what other places they should visit.<br><br><strong><em>Redbrand Ruffians:</em></strong> Sooner or later, the adventurers run into the thugs who run Phandalin. All you need to do is choose when the ruffians appear. After the characters have had a chance to visit several locations in town and talk to the townsfolk, they might decide to go looking for the Redbrands. When they do, run the “Redbrand Ruffians” encounter detailed in the next section. Alternatively, if the characters are reluctant to seek out the ruffians, the Redbrands can come looking for them at a time of your choosing.<br><br><strong><em>Finding Cragmaw Castle:</em></strong> The characters might want to seek out Cragmaw Castle to find and rescue Gundren Rockseeker. Most of the townsfolk are preoccupied with the Redbrands, and no one in town knows the location of Cragmaw Castle. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VfJWjpFfS72eIFw0\">Qelline Alderleaf</a>, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzPYLw3mbAXpmqJTjA\">Sildar Hallwinter</a>, and <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-Vh5XegLfxMNE2V7z\">Halia Thornton</a> can offer suggestions on how the party might find someone who knows the location.<hr><h3>3. Redbrand Ruffians</h3>Within a day or so of the adventurers’ arrival in Phandalin, a confrontation with the Redbrands becomes inevitable. This can happen in a number of different ways:<br><br><ul><li>After speaking with a number of NPCs in town, the characters decide to confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant tap house.</li></ul><ul><li>The characters decide to investigate Tresendar Manor. Skip the encounter and go straight to <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw3Knuas-tb23yOSyUn\">Redbrand Hideout</a>.</li></ul><ul><li>If the characters show no interest in the Redbrands, a gang of the ruffians seeks them out and picks a fight in street. Run this encounter as the characters are leaving one of the locations in the town.</li></ul><br><h4>Confrontation</h4>If the characters confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant, read:<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>The Sleeping Giant is a ramshackle taproom at the east end of town. Four human ruffians linger on the covered porch, perched on empty ale barrels or leaning against the wall. They all wear grimy scarlet cloaks, their sullen stares fixed on you as you approach.<br></em><em><br></em><em>One of the thugs spits on the ground. “Well, well,” he snarls. “Here’s a whole pack of little puppies. What do you want, puppies? Come here to bark at us?”</em></div><br>If the Redbrands confront the characters in the street, read:<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>As you head back into the street, you see four armed ruffians waiting for you. All of them are humans wearing grimy red cloaks, their hands on their weapons as they watch you.<br></em><em><br></em><em>One of the ruffians spits on the ground. “Time for you to move on, strangers. Give us your stuff, and be on your way.”</em></div>Continue the insults and baiting as long as you like. The Redbrands attack in a round or two if the characters don’t. Neither side is surprised, because it’s obvious that a fight is brewing.<br><br>The group consists of four <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzQsgtxep5jqofMX2H\"><strong>Redbrand Ruffians</strong></a>. If three of them are defeated, the last one flees toward Tresendar Manor.<br><br><h4>Developments</h4>Redbrands who are captured or charmed by the characters can impart useful information. (See the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw3rch_MTp5N9LObxd6\">What the Redbrands Know</a> handout.) Townmaster <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VecoxP4-IzGMDAbc\">Harbin Wester</a> won’t want to keep Redbrand prisoners until he knows the whole gang has been defeated, but the characters can easily persuade or intimidate him into locking up any prisoners they capture for at least a few days.<br><br>If the characters kill the ruffians, most members of the town are grateful. One exception is the townmaster, who fears Redbrand retaliation. Harbin doesn’t punish the characters but warns them not to cause trouble.<br><br><h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>Divide <strong>400 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the party defeats the ruffians.<br><br><h4>Do the Players Need Direction?</h4>After the “Redbrand Ruffians” encounter, the players should feel it’s time to deal with the rest of the gang. If they aren’t clear that investigating the Redbrand hideout should be their next move, have one of the NPCs they’ve already met in town make the suggestion directly and point them toward Tresendar Manor. If the players want to follow other leads in the area, it’s okay to move on to <strong>Act 3</strong> of the adventure and let the ruffians wait. The next time the characters return to Phandalin, make it clear that the Redbrands are causing even more trouble, and that they need to be dealt with.<hr><h3>Redbrand Hideout</h3><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><strong>Note:</strong> Redbrand Hideout utilizes a floor map – load the page \"4. Redbrand Hideout\" on the <strong>Page Toolbar</strong> to see it. There is a separate handout, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw3Knuas-tb23yOSyUn\">Redbrand Hideout Map Guide</a><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw2iW4lO7Tl52__riid\"></a>, which walks through every location on the map, the enemies/NPCs within, and the objects to be found and interacted with.</div><br>The Redbrands’ base in Phandalin is a dungeon complex under Tresendar Manor. Before the manor was ruined, its cellars served as safe storage for food and water in the event that the estate was attacked, while an adjoining crypt provided a resting place for the deceased members of the Tresendar family. The Redbrands have since expanded the cellars to suit their own purposes, adding slave pens, workshops, and barracks.<br><br>While exploring the hideout, the party will face several Redbrand Ruffians, as well as bugbears, and other monsters lurking within the manor's depths. There are also captives–specifically late Thel Dendrar's wife and children–who's dissapearance was the source of one rumor that could be overheard at the Stonehill Inn.<br><br>At the end of their ventures through the hideout, the adverturers might succeed in corning <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VEHrwVtT3SvIfnpJ\">\"Glasstaff\"</a>, who turns out to be none other than Iarno Albrek. The same person that Sildar Hallwinter has been trying to locate after the former went missing in Phandalin.<br><br><h4>Roleplaying Iarno</h4>A former member of the <em>Lords’ Alliance</em>, Iarno seized an opportunity in Phandalin to line his own pockets. Originally tasked with setting up a constabulary, the mage instead assembled a group of outlaws and local ruffians to secure his own position in town.<br><br>Iarno knew of <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzceygOS0pJnKJI3o3\">the Black Spider</a> through his contacts in the <em>Lords’ Alliance</em> and brokered a meeting. The drow promised to share the secrets and wealth of the Forge of Spells with the wizard in exchange for his help and loyalty.<br><br>Iarno puts on airs of gentility and courteous manners, addressing his ruffians as “my good gentlemen,” and referring to sordid acts such as kidnapping or arson as “that unpleasant little business” or “those unfortunate events.” He refers to the characters as “guests” and expresses regret that he cannot provide suitable entertainment for their visit. Beneath his genteel demeanor, however, Iarno is just as thuggish and arrogant as any Redbrand outlaws.<br><br>If threatened, Iarno uses his staff of defense to cast mage armor on himself. He then casts offensive spells at enemies he can see. Iarno’s stat block contains a list of the spells he has prepared. For descriptions of those spells and their effects, see the rulebook. Iarno uses the shield power of his staff for added protection.<br><br>If he is reduced to 8 or fewer hit points and has no avenues of escape, Iarno surrenders. He values his life more than anything, and he remains a model prisoner in the hopes that the Black Spider will somehow learn of his predicament and “arrange for his freedom.”<br><br>If he is questioned while in captivity, Iarno relates the following information, all of which is true:<br><br><ul><li>The Black Spider is a drow (dark elf).</li></ul><ul><li>The Black Spider sent three bugbears to help Iarno keep the population of Phandalin under control, but the Redbrands have managed without them. The bugbears know the way to Wave Echo Cave, but Iarno does not.</li></ul><ul><li>The Black Spider is searching Wave Echo Cave for the Forge of Spells. Dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver’s Pact used the magical forge to fashion powerful magic items.</li></ul><ul><li>No other members of the Lords’ Alliance know of Iarno’s betrayal.</li></ul><br><h4>Developments</h4>Various papers and notes are stacked neatly on the Glasstaff's desk in Area 12 of the Hideout, mostly consisting of Iarno’s written orders to apothecaries and alchemists in nearby settlements for more materials for his workshop. The characters also find a letter signed with the Black Spider’s symbol which you can show to the players via the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw413qQ3e7_qwn6MGFp\">A Curious Letter</a> handout. This allows the party to draw connections in the instance that Iarno manages to flee from the manor before the characters can get the chance to capture or interrogate him to learn the truth of his identity.<br><br>If Iarno is taken into custody, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzPYLw3mbAXpmqJTjA\">Sildar Hallwinter</a> arranges to have the wizard incarcerated in the townmaster’s hall until he can be safely transported back to Neverwinter. Whether Iarno stands trial for his crimes is beyond the scope of this adventure. The Black Spider is too preoccupied to meddle in the wizard’s fate.<br><br><h4>What’s Next?</h4>The next stage of the adventure continues with <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-Y4QCn2TkoI8ca84l\">Act 3: The Spider’s Web</a>, in which the characters undertake a number of short adventures that advance the story. At some point during <strong>Act 2</strong>, the characters are likely to advance to 3rd level, so make sure the players are keeping track of their XP and give them the opportunity to level up their characters.<br>",

The journey takes them south along the High Road to the Triboar Trail, which heads east (as shown on the overland map). When they’re a half-day’s march from Phandalin, they run into trouble with goblin raiders from the Cragmaw tribe.<br><br>Read the following italicised text when you’re ready to start. If you create a different adventure hook, skip to the second paragraph and adjust the details as necessary, ignoring the information about driving the wagon.<br><br></p><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named </em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzQ--Ri0JXtZc5Ss1y\">Gundren Rockseeker</a><em> asked you to bring a wagonload of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, a couple of days’ travel southeast of the city. Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found “something big,” and that he’d pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely to </em>Barthen’s Provisions<em>, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named </em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzPYLw3mbAXpmqJTjA\">Sildar Hallwinter</a><em>, claiming he needed to arrive early to “take care of business.”<br></em><em><br></em><em>You’ve spent the last few days following the High Road south from Neverwinter, and you’ve just recently veered east along the Triboar Trail. You’ve encountered no trouble so far, but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail.</em></div>Before continuing with the adventure, take a few minutes to do the following:<br><br><ul><li>Encourage the players to introduce their characters to each other if they haven’t done so already.</li></ul><br><ul><li>Ask the players to think about how their characters came to know their dwarf patron, Gundren Rockseeker. Let the players concoct their own stories. If a player is hard-pressed to think of anything, suggest something simple. For example, Gundren could be a childhood friend or someone who helped the player’s character get out of a tough scrape. This exercise is a great opportunity for the players to contribute to the adventure’s backstory.</li></ul><br><ul><li>Ask the players to give you the party’s marching order and how their characters are traveling. Who’s in front, and who’s bringing up the rear? If the characters are escorting Gundren’s wagonload of supplies, then one or two characters need to be driving the wagon. The rest of the characters can be riding on the wagon, walking alongside, or scouting ahead, as they like.</li></ul><br><h4>1a. Driving the Wagon</h4>Any character can drive a wagon, and no particular skill is necessary. Two oxen pull the wagon. If no one is holding the reins, the oxen stop where they are.<br><br>The wagon is packed full of an assortment of mining supplies and food. This includes a dozen sacks of flour, several casks of salted pork, two kegs of strong ale, shovels, picks, and crowbars (about a dozen each), and five lanterns with a small barrel of oil (about fifty flasks in volume). The total value of the cargo is 100 gp.<br><br>When you’re ready, continue with the <strong>Goblin Ambush</strong> section.<br><hr><h3>2. Goblin Ambush </h3><strong><span style=\"color: rgb( 192 , 80 , 77 )\">Roll20 Note:</span></strong> There is no Battle Map provided for the campaign's first encounter. If you would like to utilize a grid for the Goblin Ambush, we've provided the \"Random Battle Map\" Page for quick one-off fights that may occur throughout your adventure.<br><br>Read the following boxed text to start the encounter:<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>You’ve been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.</em></div><br>If you are using Gundren's adventure hook, then any character who approaches to make a closer investigation can identify the horses as belonging to Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. They’ve been dead about a day, and it’s clear that arrows killed the horses. When the characters inspect the scene closer, read the following:<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>The saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty leather map case.</em></div><br>Four <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzOZQmWHzGfufDsoXC\"><strong>Goblins</strong></a> are hiding in the woods, two on each side of the road.

Here are the steps you should follow to run it effectively:<br><br><ul><li>Review the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzOZQmWHzGfufDsoXC\">Goblin</a> NPC journal entry. Since the goblins are hiding, you’ll need to know their Stealth skill modifier: +6.</li></ul><ul><li>Check to see who, if anyone, is surprised. The party cannot surprise the goblins, but the goblins might surprise some or all the characters. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the goblins, rolling once for all of them. <em>Open the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzOZQmWHzGfufDsoXC\">goblin</a>'s <strong>Character Journal</strong> and select the tab to view its character sheet. Under Skills, click on the d20 icon beside the Stealth skill to roll it.</em> Compare the result to the characters’ passive Wisdom (Perception) scores. Any character whose score is lower than the goblins’ check result is surprised and loses his or her turn during the first round of combat (see “Surprise” in the Starter Set rulebook).</li></ul><ul><li>Use the Initiative Rules (pg. 69 of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rules Handbook),  to determine who acts first, second, third, and so on. Keep track of everyone’s initiative count via the <strong>Turn Order Tool</strong> (Clock Icon on the Toolbar)</li></ul><ul><li>When the time comes for the goblins to act, two of them rush forward and make melee attacks while two goblins stand 30 feet away from the party and make ranged attacks. The goblins’ character entry contains the information you need to resolve these attacks<span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\">.

The characters can continue on to Phandalin, buy new gear at Barthen’s Provisions, return to the ambush site, and find the goblins’ trail.<br><br>The characters might capture one or more goblins by knocking them unconscious instead of killing them. A character can use any melee weapon to knock a goblin unconscious, succeeding if the attack deals enough damage to drop the goblin to 0 hit points. Once it regains consciousness after a few minutes, a captured goblin can be convinced to share what it knows (see the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-eN_mfRVr0o6itE4v\">What the Goblins Know</a> handout). A goblin can also be persuaded to lead the party to the Cragmaw hideout while avoiding traps along the way (see the “The Goblin Trail” section below).<br><br>The characters might not find the goblin trail, or they could decide to continue to Phandalin. In that case, skip ahead to <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-XtdpvoGSfUQPRn87\">Act 2: Phandalin</a>. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-ViEkvTWyQ4cul36r\">Elmar Barthen</a> (the owner of Barthen’s Provisions) seeks out the characters and informs them that Gundren Rockseeker never arrived. He recounts the goblin troubles and suggests that the characters return to the ambush site to investigate further (after they rest). Barthen also tells the party that <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VhULocFxC8Ptd3D8\">Linene Graywind</a> of the Lionshield Coster can provide more information on the goblin attacks.<br><br><h3>3. The Goblin Trail</h3>After the characters defeat the goblins, any inspection of the area reveals that the creatures have been using this place to stage ambushes for some time. A trail hidden behind thickets on the north side of the road leads northwest. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes that about a dozen goblins have come and gone along the trail, as well as signs of two human-sized bodies being hauled away from the ambush site.<br><br>The party can easily steer the wagon away from the road and tie off the oxen while the group pursues the goblins.<br><br>The trail leads five miles northwest and ends at the Cragmaw hideout (see that section). Ask the players to determine the party’s marching order as the characters move down the trail. The order is important, because the goblins have set two traps to thwart pursuers.<br><br><strong>Snare:</strong> About 10 minutes after heading down the trail, a party on the path encounters a hidden snare. If the characters are searching for traps, the character in the lead spots the trap automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 12 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the trap. If the character fails to notice the trap, he or she triggers the snare and must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the character is suspended upside down 10 feet above the ground. The character is restrained until 1 or more slashing damage is dealt to the snare’s cord. (See \"Appendix A: Conditions\" on pg. 105 of the <a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules\"><em>Player's Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rules</em></a> for the effect of being restrained.) A character who isn’t carefully lowered down takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall.<br><br><strong>Pit:</strong> Another 10 minutes down the trail is a pit the goblins have camouflaged. The pit is 6 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and it triggers when a creature moves across it. The character in the lead spots the hidden pit automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 15 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the hidden pit. If the trap isn’t detected, the lead character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall in, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage. The pit’s walls are not steep, so no ability check is required to scramble out.<br><br><h4>3a.

When the party arrives at the hideout, award each character <strong>75 XP</strong>. Make sure the players record this gain on their character sheets.<br><br><hr><h3>4. Cragmaw Hideout</h3><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><strong>Note:</strong> Cragmaw Hideout utilizes a floor map – load the page \"2. Cragmaw Hideout\" on the <strong>Page Toolbar</strong> to see it. There is a separate handout, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw2iW4lO7Tl52__riid\">Cragmaw Hideout Map Guide</a>, which walks through every location on the map, the enemies/NPCs within, and the objects to be found and interacted with.</div><br>The Cragmaw tribe of goblins has established a hideout from which it can easily harass and plunder traffic moving along the Triboar Trail or the path to Phandalin. The Cragmaw tribe is so named because each member of the tribe sharpens its teeth so they appear fierce and jagged.<br><br>The leader of the Cragmaw bandits lairing here is a bugbear named <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzP2bvHMkzx-95a52Y\">Klarg</a>, who has orders from the chief of the Cragmaws to plunder any poorly defended caravans or travelers that come this way. A few days ago, a messenger from Cragmaw Castle brought new instructions: Waylay the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker and anyone traveling with him.<br><br>The party finds out that Gundren has already been transferred to another Cragmaw location. With enough digging for information, they can reach to the conclusion that the dwarf is now at Cragmaw Castle. While Gundren is no longer at the hideout, his travel companion, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzPYLw3mbAXpmqJTjA\">Sildar Hallwinter</a>, still is. If he is rescued and healed, Sildar Hallwinter remains with the party but is anxious to reach Phandalin as quickly as possible. He doesn’t have any weapons or armor, but he can take a shortsword from a defeated goblin or use a weapon loaned to him by a character. The party can ask the human warrior for information and they can learn the contents in the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-f-ZOsGGTBB1ixYWo\">What Sildar Knows</a> handout. <br><br>If Sildar joins the party, see the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-grGjgAZqwUGRr-lJ\">Playing NPC Party Members</a> handout for tips on how to run him.<br><br><h4>What’s Next?</h4>The next stage of the adventure takes place in Phandalin (<strong>Act 2</strong>).

They can’t learn much more in Phandalin, so they need to set out into the forests and hills surrounding the town to uncover the larger plots they are caught up in. The characters are not required to visit all the locations in this section.<br><br>Depending on which NPCs the characters met and which quests or clues they picked up, some or all the following information might be known to them:<br><br><ul><li><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VeyusJsRJ__UBxoV\">Sister Garaele</a> wants the characters to seek out the banshee Agatha in the ruined town of Conybery and ask her about Bowgentle’s spellbook.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-Vhs_-q6W7ugYXJRu\">Daran Edermath</a> wants the characters to find out who is lurking near the ruins at Old Owl Well.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VfJWjpFfS72eIFw0\">Qelline Alderleaf</a> has suggested that the characters go to the ruined town of Thundertree and consult with the druid Reidoth, who might know the whereabouts of Cragmaw Castle, Wave Echo Cave, or both.</li></ul><ul><li>Townmaster <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VecoxP4-IzGMDAbc\">Harbin Wester</a> wants the characters to seek out an orc encampment near Wyvern Tor and chase the orcs away from the area.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzPYLw3mbAXpmqJTjA\">Sildar Hallwinter</a> wants the characters to find Cragmaw Castle, search for Gundren Rockseeker, rescue the dwarf, and retrieve his map.</li></ul><br>Each of these possible quests has its own section in this part of the adventure. The characters can remain in Phandalin long enough to rest up and purchase supplies. When they’re done, have them pick a storyline to investigate, then set out for the appropriate destination.<hr><h3>Triboar Trail</h3>Phandalin lies in a part of the North known as “the Triboar Trail,” “the Triboar Cutoff,” or “the Cony Gap.” This stretch of foothills and rolling, sparsely wooded plains extends between the Sword Mountains to the south and Neverwinter Wood to the north. The area gains its name from an old trail that runs from the distant town of Triboar to the east, winding westward about one hundred miles through the abandoned village of Conyberry, then running north of Phandalin on its way to the High Road along the coast.<br><br>Describe the party’s overland travels as vividly as you like, but keep the story moving. “You walk for several miles and encounter nothing of interest” is far less evocative and memorable than, “A light rain dampens the rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday, you break for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue finds a small rock that looks like a grinning face, but otherwise you see nothing out of the ordinary.”<br><br><h4>Using the Overland Map</h4>During this part of the adventure, the characters will frequently be marching overland from one point of interest to another. As can be seen on the \"Sword Coast Map\" page in the Page Toolbar, some of these areas are a good forty to fifty miles apart, requiring several days of marching overland to travel to the next adventure site.<br><br><strong><em>Travel Time:</em></strong> Assume that the party travels twenty-four miles per day over a period of ten hours. The characters must rest for eight hours per day, with the remaining six hours consisting of making and breaking camp, preparing meals, and a little bit of foraging or hunting as the opportunity permits.<br><br><h4>Wilderness Encounters</h4>Ask the players to tell you the party’s marching order, so that you know which characters are in the lead and who’s bringing up the rear. When the party camps, ask which characters are on watch. This information is important if the party encounters something dangerous.<br><br>The Triboar Trail is not safe. As the adventurers travel throughout this area, they might stumble across hungry beasts, greedy bandits, or vicious monsters. Check for encounters once during the day and once at night by rolling a d20. On a roll of 17–20, an encounter takes place. Roll a d12 and consult the Wilderness Encounters table to determine what the party meets.<br><br>When an encounter occurs, and the adventurers gain XP if they defeat the monsters. Each creature’s stat block has the XP value for one monster of that sort. Multiply that value by the number of creatures encountered, then divide the total equally among the characters.<br><br><strong>Wilderness Encounters Chart</strong><br><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Day Roll</strong></td><td><strong>Night Roll</strong></td><td><strong>Roll Result</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1-2</td><td>1-3</td><td>Stirges (1d8+2)</td></tr><tr><td>—</td><td>4</td><td>Ghouls (1d4 + 1)</td></tr><tr><td>3-4</td><td>—</td><td>Ogre (1)</td></tr><tr><td>5-6</td><td>5</td><td>Goblins (1d6+3</td></tr><tr><td>7-8</td><td>6</td><td>Hobgoblin (1d4 + 2)</td></tr><tr><td>9-10</td><td>7-8</td><td>Orcs (1d4 + 2)</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>9-10</td><td>Wolves (1d4 + 2)</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>11-12</td><td>Owlbear (1)</td></tr></tbody></table><br><strong><em>Stirges:</em></strong> These flying predators drain the blood of their victims and are drawn to the light of campfires at night.<br><em><strong><br>Ghouls:</strong></em> These undead humans hunger for living flesh.<br><strong><em><br>Ogre:</em></strong> The ogre is looking for an easy kill.

He knows that someone called the Black Spider orchestrated his capture and hopes that the characters stop the villain.

            "notes": "<h3>Background</h3>Fifteen miles east of Phandalin, in the deep vales of the Sword Mountains, lies Wave Echo Cave. The rich mine of the Phandelver’s Pact was lost five hundred years ago during orc invasions that devastated this part of the North.<br>In the centuries since, countless prospectors and adventurers have searched for the lost mine, but none succeeded until <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-UvenWLnM2QvyP9a6\">The Rockseeker Brothers</a> found the entrance a month ago. Unfortunately, the Rockseekers did not realize they were being trailed by spies working for Nezznar <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzceygOS0pJnKJI3o3\">the Black Spider</a> and they inadvertently led the drow villain to their prize. Nezznar and his followers dealt with the two Rockseekers who were guarding their find, then arranged for Gundren’s ambush. Learning of the adventurers’ involvement with Gundren or their exploits in and around Phandalin, the Black Spider has given orders for the characters to be dealt with. Meanwhile, Nezznar has begun his exploration of Wave Echo Cave.<br><br>The drow is searching for the Forge of Spells, where the human mages of old Phandalin enchanted dwarven weapons and gnome gadgets. However, Nezznar’s exploration has been hindered by the restless undead and dangerous monsters that lurk in Wave Echo Cave, forcing him to proceed with great caution.<br><br>The adventurers now have the chance to aid Gundren, avenge his kin, and put a stop to the nefarious schemes of the Black Spider. And of course, the hoard of powerful magic rumored to be hidden in the mines is a rich prize.<br><hr><h3>Character Level</h3>This part of the adventure is designed for characters of at least 4th level and assumes that each character has earned at least <strong>2,700 XP</strong>. If the adventurers skipped too many of the optional investigations and encounters in Act 3, they might not be 4th level, and many of the encounters in this section might be difficult for them.<br><hr><h3>Experience Point Awards</h3>In this part of the adventure, XP is awarded for overcoming monsters, as in Acts 2 and 3. However, XP awards for monsters is not given in the encounter description. Instead, the amount of XP that a monster is worth is noted in its stat block on their character entry. You calculate the award by totaling the value for each monster the characters overcome. Additional XP awards, and the reasons for them, are described in the text, under the “Awarding Experience Points” heading.<hr><h3>Wandering Monsters</h3>Monsters roam through all areas of the mine. Random encounters remind players that monsters aren’t necessarily confined to specific areas, and that no part of the dungeon is safe. Encounters with wandering monsters are an effective way to keep the players and characters on their toes, alleviate player boredom, and tax party resources. However, having too many random encounters can become tedious, so use them sparingly.<br><br>If the characters spend a long time in a given area, you can check for wandering monsters by rolling a d20. On a roll of 17–20, an encounter takes place. Conversely, if the players seem restless, you can decide that an encounter occurs. Roll a d12 and consult the Wandering Monsters table to determine what the party meets.<br><br><strong>Wandering Monsters Encounters Chart</strong><br><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>d12 Roll</strong></td><td><strong>Result</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1–3</td><td>Stirges (2d4)</td></tr><tr><td>4–5</td><td>Ghouls (1d4)</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Gricks (1d4)</td></tr><tr><td>7–8</td><td>Bugbears (1d4)</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Skeletons (1d6)</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Zombies (1d6)</td></tr><tr><td>11–12</td><td>Ochre Jelly (1)</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h3>Booming Waves</h3>All good dungeons have characteristics that make them unique, and Wave Echo Cave is no exception. The rhythmic thunder of pounding waves echoes throughout the mine, loud enough to make the stone underfoot shiver. Waves come about two minutes apart, growing louder toward the northeast. <br><br>Wave Echo Cave is nowhere near the ocean, but a water-filled cavern deep in the mine is connected to an underground hot spring. That spring boils over continuously to produce a surge that slams into a narrow funnel, making a sound like breaking surf. Describe this sound to players on occasion. It will pique their curiosity and lure them toward its source, drawing them deeper into the mine as a consequence.<hr><h3>Keyed Encounters</h3>All the encounters in Act 4 of this adventure are keyed to the map of Wave Echo Cave. You can follow along on the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw8PMfC6dihInlzSL6n\">Wave Echo Cave Map Guide</a> and the \"6.

The entrance is at the foot of a good-sized hill, and the caves and passages are inside the hill itself.<br><br><strong><em>Ceilings:</em></strong> Most of the caves and passages have steeply sloping ceilings that create stalactite-covered vaults rising 20 to 30 feet above the floor.<br><br><strong><em>Light:</em></strong> Areas 1 and 2 are outside. The rest of the complex is dark unless stated otherwise. The boxed text for those locations assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.<br><br><strong><em>Rubble:</em></strong> Areas of crumbling rock and gravel are difficult terrain (See pg. 70 under \"Difficult Terrain\" in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rules Handbook</em>).<br><br><em><strong>Sound:</strong></em> The sound of water in the cave muffles noises to any creatures that aren’t listening carefully. Creatures can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to attempt to hear activity in nearby chambers.<br><br><strong><em>Stalagmites:</em></strong> These upthrust spires of rock can provide cover (See pg. 74 under \"Cover\" in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rules Handbook</em>).<br><br><strong><em>Stream:</em></strong> The stream that flows through the complex is only 2 feet deep, cold, and slow moving, allowing creatures to easily wade through it.<hr><h3>Area 1 - Cave Mouth</h3>The trail from the goblin ambush site leads to the entrance of the Cragmaw hideout.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>Following the goblins’ trail, you come across a large cave in a hillside five miles from the scene of the ambush. A shallow stream flows out of the cave mouth, which is screened by dense briar thickets. A narrow dry path leads into the cave on the right-hand side of the stream.</em></div><br>The thicket in Area 2 is impenetrable from the west side of the stream.<br><br><h4>Developments</h4>The <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzOZQmWHzGfufDsoXC\"><strong>Goblins</strong></a> in Area 2 are supposed to be keeping watch on this area, but they are not paying attention. (Goblins can be lazy that way.) However, if the characters make a lot of noise here—for example, loudly arguing about what to do next, setting up a camp, cutting down brush, and so on—the goblins in area 2 notice and attack them through the thicket, which provides the goblins with three-quarters cover (See pg. 74 under \"Cover\" in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rules Handbook</em>).<br><hr><h3>Area 2 - Goblin Blind</h3>When the characters cross to the east side of the stream, they can see around the screening thickets to Area 2. This is a goblin guard post, though the goblins here are bored and inattentive.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>On the east side of the stream flowing from the cave mouth, a small area in the briar thickets has been hollowed out to form a lookout post or blind.

If the goblins notice intruders in Area 1, they open fire with their bows, shooting through the thickets and probably catching the characters by surprise. If the goblins don’t notice the adventurers in Area 1, they spot them when they splash across the stream, and neither side is surprised.<br><br>Characters moving carefully or scouting ahead might be able to surprise the goblin lookouts. Have each character who moves ahead make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the goblins’ passive Wisdom (Perception) score to avoid being surprised. (See “Contests” in Chapter 7 of the Basic Rules handbook for more information.)<br><br><strong><em>Thickets:</em></strong> The thickets around the clearing are difficult terrain, but they aren’t dangerous—just annoying. They provide half cover to creatures attacking through them. (See “Difficult Terrain” and “Cover” in Chapter 9 of the Basic Rules handbook for more information.)<hr><h3>Area 3 - Kennel</h3>The Cragmaws keep a kennel of foul-tempered wolves that they are training for battle.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>Just inside the cave mouth, a few uneven stone steps lead up to a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage. The cave narrows to a steep fissure at the far end, and is filled with the stench of animals. Savage snarls and the sounds of rattling chains greet your ears where three wolves are chained up just inside the opening. Each wolf’s chain leads to an iron rod driven into the base of a stalagmite.</em></div>Three <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzOrpqtEckiSfdDh2g\"><strong>Wolves</strong></a> are confined here. They can’t reach targets standing on the steps, but all three attack any creature except a goblin that moves into the room (see the “Developments” section below). Goblins in nearby caves ignore the sounds of fighting wolves, since they constantly snap and snarl at each other.<br><br>A character who tries to calm the animals can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a success, the wolves allow the character to move throughout the room. If the wolves are given food, the DC drops to 10.<br><br><strong><em>Fissure:</em></strong> A narrow opening in the east wall leads to a natural chimney that climbs 30 feet to Area 8. At the base of the fissure is rubbish that’s been discarded through the opening above. A character attempting to ascend or descend the chimney shaft must make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check succeeds, the character moves at half speed up or down the shaft, as desired. <br><br>On a check result of 6–9, the character neither gains nor loses ground; on a result of 5 or less, the character falls and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the base of the shaft.<br><br><h4>Developments</h4>If the wolves are goaded by enemies beyond their reach, they are driven into a frenzy that allows them to yank the iron rod securing their chains out of the floor. Each round that any character remains in sight, the wolves attempt a single DC 15 Strength check. On the first success, they loosen the rod and the DC drops to 10. On a second success, they yank the rod loose, bending it so that their chains are freed.<br><br>A goblin or bugbear can use its action to release one wolf from its chain.<hr><h3>Area 4 - Steep Passage</h3>From this point on, characters without darkvision will need light to see their surroundings.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>The main passage from the cave mouth climbs steeply upward, the stream plunging and splashing down its west side. In the shadows, a side passage leads west across the other side of the stream.</em></div>Characters using light or darkvision to look farther up the passage spot the bridge at Area 5. Add:<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>In the shadows of the ceiling to the north, you can just make out the dim shape of a rickety bridge of wood and rope crossing over the passage ahead of you. Another passage intersects this one, twenty feet above the floor.</em></div>Any character who can see the bridge in area 5 might also notice the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzOZQmWHzGfufDsoXC\"><strong>Goblin</strong></a> guarding the bridge. Doing so requires a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the goblin’s Dexterity (Stealth) check result.<br><br>The goblin notices the characters if they carry any light or don’t use stealth as they approach the bridge. The goblin does not attack. Instead, it attempts to sneak away to the east to inform its companions in Area 7 to release a flood (see the <strong>“Flood!”</strong> section of Area 5 below). The goblin moves undetected if its Dexterity (Stealth) check exceeds the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of any character who might notice its movements.<br><br><strong><em>Western Passage:</em></strong> This passage is choked with rubble and has steep escarpments. Treat the area as difficult terrain (See pg. 70 under \"Difficult Terrain\" in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rules Handbook</em>).<span style=\"color: rgb( 192 , 80 , 77 )\"></span><br><br>The ledge between the two escarpments is fragile. Any weight in excess of 100 pounds loosens the whole mass and sends it tumbling down to the east. Any creature on the ledge when it falls must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. The creature also falls prone on a failed save (See \"Appendix A: Conditions\" on pg. 105 of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rules Handbook</em> for the effect of becoming prone).<hr><h3>Area 5 - Overpass</h3>Where a high tunnel passes through the larger tunnel cavern below, the goblins have set up a bridge guard post.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>The stream passage continues up beyond another set of uneven steps ahead, bending eastward as it goes. A waterfall sounds out from a larger cavern somewhere ahead of you.</em></div><br>If the characters didn’t spot the bridge while navigating Area 4, they spot it now. Add:<br><br>Flavor Text:<br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>A rickety bridge spans the passage, connecting two tunnels that are 20 feet above the stream.</em></div><br>One <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzOZQmWHzGfufDsoXC\"><strong>Goblin</strong></a> stands watch on the bridge. It is hiding, and characters can spot it by succeeding on a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the goblin’s Dexterity (Stealth) check. This guard is lazy and inattentive. If no characters are using light sources, each character can attempt a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the goblin’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to creep by without being noticed.<br><br>If the goblin spots the adventurers, it signals the goblins in Area 7 to release a flood (see the <strong>“Flood!”</strong> section below), then throws javelins down at the characters.<br><br><strong><em>Bridge:</em></strong> This bridge spans the passage 20 feet above the stream. It’s possible to climb up the cavern walls from the lower passage to the bridge. The 20-foot-high walls are rough but slick with spray, requiring a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb.<br><br>The bridge has an Armor Class (AC) of 5 and 10 hit points. If the bridge is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses. Creatures on the collapsing bridge must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing prone (See \"Appendix A: Conditions\" on pg. 105 of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rules Handbook</em> for the effect of becoming prone). Those who succeed hold onto the bridge and must climb it to safety.<br><br><h4>Flood!</h4>The large pools in Area 7 have collapsible walls that can be yanked out of place to release a surge of water down the main passage of the lair. In the round after the goblins in Area 7 are signaled by the lookout in Area 5, they start knocking away the supports. In the following round on the goblins’ initiative count, a water surge pours from Area 7 down to Area 1.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>The passage is suddenly filled with a mighty roar, as a huge surge of rushing water pours down from above!</em></div>The flood threatens all creatures in the tunnel. (Creatures on the bridge at Area 5 are out of danger, as are any characters successfully climbing the cavern walls.) Any creature within 10 feet of the disused passage at Area 4 or the steps leading up to Area 3 can attempt a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being swept away. A creature that fails to get out of the way can attempt a DC 15 Strength saving throw to hold on. On a failed save, the character is knocked prone and washed down to Area 1, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage along the way.<br><br>The goblins in Area 7 can release a second flood by opening the second pool, but they don’t do this unless the goblin on the bridge tells them to. The goblin on the bridge waits to see if the first flood got rid of all the intruders before calling for the second to be released.<hr><h3>Area 6 - Goblin Den</h3>The Cragmaw raiders stationed in the hideout use this area as a common room and barracks.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>This large cave is divided in half by a ten-foot-high escarpment. A steep natural staircase leads from the lower portion to the upper ledge.

The five ordinary goblins tend the cooking fire in the lower (northern) part of the cave near the entrance passage, while the leader rests in the upper (southern) part of the cave.<br><br><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzPYLw3mbAXpmqJTjA\">Sildar Hallwinter</a>, a human warrior, is held prisoner in this chamber. He is securely bound on the southern ledge of the cavern. The goblins have been beating and tormenting him, so he is weak and at 1 hit point.<br><br>The goblin leader, Yeemik, is second-in-command of the whole hideout. If he sees that the characters are getting the upper hand, he grabs Sildar and drags him over to the edge of the upper level. “Truce, or this human dies!” he shouts.<br>Yeemik wants to oust Klarg and become the new boss. If the adventurers agree to parley, Yeemik tries to convince them to kill Klarg in Area 8, promising to release Sildar when they bring back the bugbear’s head. Sildar groggily warns the characters that they shouldn’t trust the goblin, and he’s right. If the characters take the deal, Yeemik tries to force them to pay a rich ransom for Sildar even after they complete their part of the bargain.<br><br>If the characters refuse to parley, Yeemik shoves Sildar over the edge and <span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\">continues with the fight. Sildar takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall, which is enough to drop him to 0 hit points. Quick-acting characters can try to stabilize him before he dies (see \"Damage and Healing\" on pg. 74 of the Basic Rules handbook).</span><span style=\"color: rgb( 192 , 80 , 77 )\"><br></span><hr id=\"userscript-horizontalrule\"><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\">Developments</span></h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\">If he is rescued and healed, Sildar Hallwinter remains with the party but is anxious to reach Phandalin as quickly as possible. He doesn’t have any weapons or armor, but he can take a shortsword from a defeated goblin or use a weapon loaned to him by a character. If the party asks Sildar about Gundren and his whereabouts, refer to the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-f-ZOsGGTBB1ixYWo\">What Sildar Knows</a> handout.<br><br>Sildar tells the characters that he intends to continue on to Phandalin, since it’s the nearest settlement. He offers to pay the party 50 gp to provide escort. Although he has no money on him, Sildar can secure a loan to pay the characters within a day after arriving in Phandalin. First, he hopes they’ll put a stop to the goblin raids by clearing out the caves.<br><br>If Sildar joins the party, see the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-grGjgAZqwUGRr-lJ\">Playing NPC Party Members</a> handout for tips on how to run him.<br><br></span><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\">Treasure</span></h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\">Yeemik carries a pouch containing three gold teeth (1 gp each) and 15 sp.

A narrow waterfall high in the eastern wall feeds the pool, which drains out the western end of the chamber to form the stream that flows out of the cave mouth below. Low fieldstone walls serve as dams holding the water in. A wide exit stands to the south, while two smaller passages lead west. The sound of the waterfall echoes through the cavern, making it difficult to hear.</em></div>Three <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzOZQmWHzGfufDsoXC\">Goblins</a> guard this cave. If the goblin in Area 5 spotted the characters and warned the goblins here, they are ready for trouble. The noise of the waterfall means that the creatures in Area 8 can’t hear any fighting that takes place here, and vice versa. Therefore, as soon as a fight breaks out here, one goblin flees to Area 8 to warn <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzQoXJiumzgkP6iUHN\">Klarg</a>.<br><br><strong><em>Rock Dams:</em></strong> The goblins built simple dams to control the flow of water through the heart of the complex. If the goblin sentry in Area 5 has called for the goblins here to release a flood, one or both of the pools are mostly empty and the stream is flowing unimpeded.<hr><h3>Area 8 - Klarg’s Cave</h3>The leader of the goblinoids insists on keeping the bulk of the raiders’ stolen goods in his den. The Cragmaws’ plunder from the last month of raiding and ambushing caravans is here.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>Sacks and crates of looted provisions are piled up in the south end of this large cave. To the west, the floor slopes toward a narrow opening that descends into darkness. A larger opening leads north down a set of natural stone steps, the roar of falling water echoing from beyond. In the middle of the cavern, the coals of a large fire smolder.</em></div>Klarg the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzQoXJiumzgkP6iUHN\">bugbear</a> shares this cave with his mangy pet <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzOrpqtEckiSfdDh2g\">Wolf</a>, Ripper, and two <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzOZQmWHzGfufDsoXC\">Goblins</a>. The bugbear is filled with delusions of grandeur and views himself as a mighty warlord just beginning his career of conquest. He is not entirely sane, referring to himself in the third person (“Who dares defy Klarg?” or “Klarg will build a throne from your bones, puny ones!”). The goblins under his command resent his bullying.<br><br><strong><em>Fire Pit:</em></strong> The hot coals in the central fire pit deal 1 fire damage to any creature that enters the fire pit, or 1d6 fire damage to any creature that falls prone there. A creature can take each type of damage only once per round.<br><br><strong><em>Natural Chimney:</em></strong> A niche in the western wall forms the top of a shaft that descends 30 feet to area 3. See that area for information on climbing the natural chimney.<br><br><strong><em>Supplies:</em></strong> The piles of sacks and crates can provide half cover to any creature fighting or hiding behind them. Most are marked with the image of a blue lion—the symbol of the Lionshield Coster, a merchant company with a warehouse and trading post in Phandalin.<br><br>Hidden among the supplies is an unlocked treasure chest belonging to Klarg (see the “Treasure” section). Any character who searches the supplies finds the chest.<br><br><h4>Developments</h4>If Klarg is warned by the goblins in Area 7 that the hideout is under attack, he and his wolf hide behind stalagmites while the goblins take cover behind the piles of supplies, hoping to ambush the characters when they enter the cave.<br><br>If Klarg and company are not warned about possible attackers, the characters have a good chance to surprise them. The easiest way for the characters to achieve this is to climb the chimney from Area 3, since Klarg does not expect an attack from that direction.<br><br>If the wolf is killed, the bugbear attempts to climb down the chimney to Area 3 and flee the cave complex.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The captured stores are bulky, and the characters will need a wagon to transport them. If they return the supplies to the Lionshield Coster in Phandalin (see part 2, “Phandalin”), they earn a reward of 50 gp and the friendship of Linene and her company.<br><br>In addition to the stolen provisions, Klarg has a treasure chest that contains 600 cp, 110 sp, two potions of healing, and a jade statuette of a frog with tiny golden orbs for eyes (40 gp). The frog statuette is small enough to fit in a pocket or pouch.<br><hr>",

Cragmaw Castle\" page in the <strong>Page Toolbar</strong> for the dungeon floor map.<br><br>The Cragmaw tribe consists of marauding bands and rival goblinholds scattered throughout the area of the Triboar Trail and the Neverwinter Wood. However, one chieftain is grudgingly recognized by all others as supreme: King Grol of Cragmaw Castle.<br><br>Cragmaw Castle is not a goblin construction, nor is that the structure’s original name. Raised by a talented wizard-noble of old Phalorm, an ancient realm that once controlled much of the North, the stronghold consists of seven overlapping towers; however, its upper levels have long since collapsed to heaps of crumbling masonry. Only the ground floor is still sound enough to be habitable.<hr><h3>General Features</h3>The centuries have not been kind to Cragmaw Castle. The goblins have shored up the weakest areas beneath its falling towers with crude timbers, but it’s only a matter of time before the structure collapses completely.<br><br><strong><em>Ceilings:</em></strong> Ceilings are 15 feet high unless noted otherwise.<br><br><strong><em>Doors:</em></strong> Interior doors are made of wood reinforced with iron bands. They have neither locks nor keyholes. It takes a successful DC 15 Strength check to break down a door that is barricaded shut.<br><br><strong><em>Floors:</em></strong> Cracked and uneven flagstones conceal a dirt floor underneath.<br><br><strong><em>Light:</em></strong> A small amount of natural light filters through the arrow slits around the castle. During the day, this provides dim light in most areas. At night, all areas are dark.<br><br><strong><em>Walls:</em></strong> Exterior walls and load-bearing interior walls are 5 feet thick, with 3 feet of mortared fill sandwiched between 1-foot-thick courses of hard stone blocks. Interior walls are 1-foot-thick worked stone.<br><br>Arrow slits in the castle walls are 10 feet above the outside ground level, 4 feet above the interior floor level, 8 inches wide, and 4 feet high. A creature on one side of an arrow slit gains three-quarters cover against attacks from the other side (see pg. 74 under \"Cover\" in the <a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules\"><em>Player's Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rules</em></a>).<br><hr><h3>Area 1 - Castle Entrance</h3>The main gates between Areas 1 and 2 are made of bronze-covered wood, but they are corroded and collapsed.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>The castle consists of seven crumbling towers of different sizes and heights, but the upper stories are all in varying states of collapse. A short flight of steps leads up to a terrace in front of the main entryway. Past the wreckage of a pair of sundered doors lies a shadowed hall. Round towers loom over the entranceway, with dark arrow slits looking down on the terrace.</em></div>No monsters dwell here, but the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzOZQmWHzGfufDsoXC\"><strong>Goblin</strong></a> sentries in Area 3 are supposed to be keeping watch. They glance only occasionally out of the arrow slits, however, so characters who move quietly might be able to creep past them. Have each character make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. The lowest check is the DC for the goblins’ Wisdom checks to notice the party.<br><br><h4>Developments</h4>If the goblins spot the characters (or if the characters approach openly), the goblins shoot arrows from behind the arrow slits. However, they can’t fire directly at enemies at or past the broken gate. The goblins also shout loudly enough to alert their comrades in Areas 4 and 6 that the castle is under attack.<br><hr><h3>Area 2 - Trapped Hall</h3>Once the castle’s foyer, this wide hall makes a dangerous battleground.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>Doors stand closed to the north and south, with a crumbling mound of rubble partially obscuring the southern hall. To the east, a broad corridor ends in two more doors leading south and east.

They attack from both directions, trying to overwhelm the adventurers and drive them out of the castle.<br><br><strong><em>Trap:</em></strong> The dusty plaster and rubble in front of the door leading to area 8 conceals a copper tripwire connected to linchpins hidden in the ruined ceiling. Spotting the tripwire requires a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of at least 20, or a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check if characters are actively searching for traps in the area. Once spotted, the tripwire is easily avoided and disarmed (no ability check required).<br><br>Any creature that walks over or through the rubble without avoiding the tripwire triggers a cave-in of wooden beams and heavy stones. (The area of the collapse is marked on the map.) Any creature in the area when the trap triggers must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage from the falling rubble (half as much damage on a successful save). The noise of the collapse puts the monsters in Areas 3, 7, 8, and 9 on alert.<br><br><h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>Divide <strong>100 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the party detects or survives the trap.<br><hr><h3>Area 3 - Archer Post</h3>Cragmaw Castle’s main defenses are its secret location and the appearance of having been abandoned.

Among the supplies, you see a bloody suit of chain mail, a heavy crossbow, and an unsheathed longsword with the emblem of Neverwinter worked into its hilt.</em></div>Though the stores here are not edible by human standards, the goblins can tolerate them when fresher food isn’t available.<br><br>One small cask is filled with an exceptional dwarven brandy, which the goblins overlooked because of its size. The cask contains the equivalent of twenty glasses. A character who imbibes a glass of brandy regains 1 hit point, but a character who drinks two glasses within 1 hour becomes poisoned for 1 hour.<br><br><strong><em>Sildar’s Gear:</em></strong> The chain mail and longsword belong to <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzPYLw3mbAXpmqJTjA\">Sildar Hallwinter</a>. Sildar is grateful if at least his longsword is returned to him.<hr><h3>Area 6 - Hobgoblin Barracks</h3>The Cragmaws are a mixed tribe of goblinoids, with a handful of bugbears lording over larger numbers of miserable goblins and a few hobgoblins. The hobgoblins plan to dispose of the bugbears and take over someday, but for now, the bugbears are too strong a threat.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>Four plain straw pallets and bedrolls are lined up on the floor of this barracks. Brackets on the walls hold a number of weapons—spears, swords, morningstars, and more.

However, they are quick to defend their tower if any intruders appear, or to respond to an alarm raised by the goblin sentries.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Mounted to the walls are five spears, four longswords, three morningstars, two greatswords, and a fine quarterstaff. The quarterstaff is engraved with stylized feathers, is surprisingly light (1 lb.), and worth 10 gp.<br><br><h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>Divide <strong>400 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the party defeats the hobgoblins in this room.<br><hr><h3>Area 7 - Banquet Hall</h3>The lord of the castle once entertained his guests here, throwing lavish banquets and dances.

Dirty dishes, half-full stewpots, moldy heels of bread, and gnawed bones cover the tables.</em></div>This hall holds seven miserable goblins and their leader—a fat, cantankerous <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzOZQmWHzGfufDsoXC\">Goblin</a></strong> with 12 hit points named Yegg. Yegg is the chief cook for the Cragmaws, and he viciously bullies his unwilling assistants as they go about the work of putting food on the tribe’s table. If Yegg is killed, any goblins left alive flee to the east or west, avoiding the north door because of the trap in Area 2.<br><br><h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>Divide <strong>400 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the party defeats the goblins in this room.<br><hr><h3>Area 8 - Dark Hall</h3>Even by day, this area has no exterior light.

The grick likes to climb up to a ledge hidden in the shadows of the statuary in the higher reaches of the room. It quietly observes intruders that enter the area before dropping down to strike. Compare the grick’s Dexterity (Stealth) check to the characters’ Wisdom (Perception) checks (or their passive scores) to determine who among them is surprised. The grick knows that goblins are not to be eaten unless Lhupo says so. The rest of the Cragmaws are terrified of Lhupo’s pet and hurry through this room, preferably in twos or threes.<br><br>Any cleric who examines the chapel’s decor can attempt a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check to identify the deities that were once revered here: Oghma (god of knowledge), Mystra (goddess of magic), Lathander (god of dawn), and Tymora (goddess of luck). This is an obvious sign that the builders of the castle were human.<br><br><h4>Developments</h4>If combat erupts here, the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzOZQmWHzGfufDsoXC\"><strong>Goblins</strong></a> in Area 9 cannot be surprised.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The stone brazier contains a mound of coal, buried under which is a gold statuette of a sun elf (100 gp) wrapped in crimson cloth.

The western end of the complex is lower than the eastern end, with stairs leading down as the characters explore.<br><br><div><strong><em>Ceilings:</em></strong> Passages and chambers are 10 feet high unless otherwise indicated.</div><div><strong><em>Doors:</em></strong> All doors are made of wood with iron handles, hinges, and built-in locks. They are unlocked unless the text states otherwise. Iarno Albrek (area 12) and a bugbear named Mosk (area 9) each carry an iron key that can lock or unlock every door in the complex.</div><div>A locked door can be picked with thieves’ tools and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. A door can also be broken down with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</div><div><strong><em>Secret Doors:</em></strong> An “S” on the Redbrand Hideout map indicates the location of a secret door.</div><div>Secret doors are made of stone and blend in with the surrounding walls. Spotting a secret door from a distance of no more than 10 feet without actively searching for it requires a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher, whereas a character who takes the time to search the wall can find the secret door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Secret doors swing open on hidden iron hinges and are not locked.</div><div><strong><em>Light:</em></strong> Most areas are brightly lit by oil lamps in wall sconces, refilled every few hours as needed.</div>If the characters begin their search at Tresendar Manor, they enter the dungeon in Area 1. If they instead follow Carp Alderleaf to the secret tunnel the lad found, they enter the dungeon by way of Area 8.<br><hr><h3>Area 1 - Cellar</h3>Any exploration of the manor grounds finds it deserted, but with plenty of tracks leading to a stone staircase just off the empty ruin of a large kitchen. At the bottom of the stairs stands an unlocked door with a cellar beyond.<br><br>When the characters open the door, read the following:<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>The door opens onto a five-foot-wide landing fifteen feet above a large cellar, with stone steps descending to the floor in two short flights. Another door stands beneath the stairs to the north. A large stone cistern occupies the western part of the room, whose walls are lined with kegs and barrels.</em></div>This room appears to be a large storage cellar, exactly the sort of thing one might expect to find beneath an old manor. The Redbrands want to keep their base of operations hidden, so other than the barrels filled with fresh provisions, nothing in this room gives away their presence.<br><br>The barrels contain salted pork and beef, flour, sugar, apples, and ale. Moving barrels around to thoroughly search them is a noisy activity that attracts the attention of the Redbrands in area 2.<br><br><strong><em>Cistern:</em></strong> This rectangular reservoir is clean and filled with cold, fresh water. It is 10 feet deep with a rim 2 feet higher than the surrounding floor (so that the bottom of the cistern is 8 feet below the floor). Drain pipes from the roof of the old manor above fill the cistern with water.<br><br>A waterproof satchel hangs from a submerged rope attached along the south wall of the cistern, about 2 feet below the surface of the water. It’s not visible from above the water, but can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or automatically by a character probing the cistern with a pole or jumping in. The satchel contains some valuable items (see the “Treasure” section).<br><br><strong><em>Secret Door:</em></strong> A secret door is located in the southwest corner of the room. See the “General Features” section for more information on secret doors.<br><br><h4>Developments</h4>No monsters or villains are found in this area, but the ruffians in area 2 take notice if the characters make a lot of noise here. They creep into the room, gaining surprise if the characters don’t hear them (see “Surprise” in the rulebook). If the ruffians fight in this area and two are defeated, the last ruffian might reveal the secret door by fleeing in that direction.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The satchel hidden in the cistern is waterproof and contains a <em>potion of healing</em>, a <em>potion of invisibility</em>, 50 gp, and a clean set of ordinary travel clothing. This is a getaway kit that Iarno keeps here in case of an emergency.<br><hr><h3>Area 2 - Barracks</h3>Most of the Redbrands’ human members have lodgings in Phandalin. This barracks is a good place to lie low after shaking down local miners and fur traders.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>This appears to be a storeroom pressed into service as living quarters.

If they hear a good deal of noise in area 1 (including loud voices or barrels being rolled around), they prepare themselves for a fight and try to surprise intruders.<br><br>The barrels here contain similar provisions to those in area 1.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>All three Redbrands wear belt pouches holding treasure. The first holds 16 sp and 7 gp; the second, 12 sp and 5 gp; and the third, 15 ep and two garnets (10 gp each).

The walls are decorated with faux columns every ten feet, and the double doors at the west end of the hall are sheathed in copper plate, now green with age. A relief carving of a mournful angel graces the doors.</em></div>The pit trap in the middle of the hallway is hidden under a false floor consisting of loose stone tiles laid atop breakaway timbers. The tiles and timbers collapse under 100 or more pounds of weight. A character searching the hall for traps can spot the covered pit with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. A successful check also reveals narrow ledges on the north and south sides of the pit. A creature attempting to skirt around the pit using one of these ledges must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.<br><br>A creature that triggers the trap or fails the Dexterity check to skirt around the edge of the pit must attempt a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to catch the edge. On a failed save, the creature falls 20 feet to the dirt floor of the pit, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing prone.<br><br><h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>Divide <strong>100 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the party avoids or survives the pit trap.<hr><h3>Area 4 - Tresendar Crypts</h3>The elders of the long-gone Tresendar family were once laid to rest in this mausoleum.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>Three large stone sarcophagi stand within this dusty crypt, and propped up against each sarcophagus is a human skeleton clad in bits of rusty mail.

If opened, the tombs contain mostly moldering bones and scraps of clothing, but see the “Treasure” section.<br><br><h4>Developments</h4>Fighting in this room alerts the Redbrands in area 5 that trouble is on the way.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Amid the bones in each sarcophagus is a platinum signet ring (50 gp).<br><br><h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>Divide <strong>150 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the party defeats the skeletons.<br><hr><h3>Area 5 - Slave Pens</h3>For the past two months, the Redbrands have been capturing travelers in the area and holding them in these pens until they can be sold into slavery.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:<br><em>This long room is partitioned into three areas, with iron bars walling off the north and south. Filthy straw lines the floors of those cells, the hinged doors of which are secured by chains and padlocks. A pair of disheveled human women are held in the cell to the south, while a human boy is confined to the north. All are dressed in plain gray tunics and have iron collars fitted around their necks.<br><br>A heap of discarded clothing is piled carelessly against the far wall.</em></div>Two <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzQsgtxep5jqofMX2H\"><strong>Redbrand Ruffians</strong></a> in scarlet cloaks stand guard here, though they spend most of their time taunting the hapless prisoners (see the “Captives” section). If they hear fighting in Area 5, they take up positions against the wall near the door, then try to surprise intruders. The captives are too intimidated to shout warnings or call for help.<br><br>The heap of clothing belongs to the various captives who have been housed here over the last two months—at least a dozen people to judge by the size of the pile.<br><br><strong><em>Cell Doors:</em></strong> The cell doors feature simple locks requiring thieves’ tools and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check to pick. The doors can also be wrenched open by brute force with a successful DC 22 Strength check.<br><br><h4>Captives</h4>The three human commoners imprisoned here are Mirna Dendrar and her two teenage children, thirteen-year-old Nars and eighteen-year-old Nilsa. A few days ago, the Redbrands murdered Mirna’s husband, Thel, for defying them. (His corpse can be found in Area 8.) That night, the gang returned and abducted the family from their home in Phandalin. The gang plans to sell the family into slavery.<br><br>The Dendrars are grateful to the characters for rescuing them, but they can’t provide much information about the Redbrand hideout. All they know is that the boss is a wizard (though they haven’t met him and don’t know his name), and that he has “tall, furry monsters with big ears” (bugbears) working for him.<br><br><strong><em>Side Quest - Mirna’s Heirloom:</em></strong> Though her family has nothing to offer as a reward, Mirna tells the characters that she might know where a valuable heirloom is hidden. When she was a young girl, she and her family fled from the town of Thundertree after undead overran the place. Her family had an herb and alchemy shop, inside which a case containing an emerald necklace was hidden beneath a section of storage shelves. She never dared to return and retrieve it. The shop was in the southeast part of Thundertree. If the characters decide to explore the ruins of Thundertree, see <strong>Act 3</strong> of the adventure.<br><br><h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>Divide <strong>200 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the party defeats the ruffians. Divide <strong>100 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the Dendrars make it back to town alive.<br><hr><h3>Area 6 - Armory</h3>The door to this room is locked from the outside. Across from the locked door is a secret door that leads to Area 7. For more information on locked doors and secret doors, see the “General Features” section at the top of this handout.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>Racks of weapons line the walls of this chamber, including spears, swords, crossbows, and bolts. A dozen dirty red cloaks hang from hooks by the door.</em></div>The Redbrands have ambitious plans to expand their numbers in the near future, so they have been stockpiling arms and armor.<br><br>The weapon racks hold twelve spears, six shortswords, four longswords, six light crossbows, and eight quivers holding twenty crossbow bolts each.<br><hr><h3>Area 7 - Storeroom and Work Area</h3>In this chamber, the Redbrands take stock of their stolen wares, either shipping them out through the cavern to the south or packaging them for storage in the stronghold.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>This area is the north end of a large natural cavern, but it has been finished with dressed stone block walls and a flagstone floor. Several barrels are stored against the walls here, along with a number of empty crates, straw for packing, hammers, pry bars, and nails.<br></em><em><br></em><em>The cavern continues for some distance to the south. You can make out several passages that open up off the larger cavern, and what looks like a deep pit or crevasse in the floor.</em></div>This room contains two secret doors, one leading to Area 6 and the other to Area 12. See the “General Features” section at the top of this handout for more information on secret doors.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Most of the provisions and goods here aren’t valuable, but lying among them are thirty beaver pelts (2 gp each). They were looted from a caravan on the Triboar Trail a few days ago.<br><hr><h3>Area 8 - Crevasse</h3>The characters arrive here by one of three routes: the tunnel from area 1, the storeroom at area 7, or the rough-hewn passage to the south, which continues off the map for about one hundred feet and emerges from a tunnel in the woods south of Tresendar Manor. The passage is an excellent way to smuggle people or goods in and out of Phandalin without being seen, and is thus perfect for a gang of slavers and thieves.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>A cold breeze fills this large natural cavern, carrying with it the faint scent of decaying flesh. A crevasse divides the cavern and is flanked by two rough stone columns that support the twenty-foot-high ceiling. Two arched wooden bridges span the chasm.</em></div>The guardian of this cave is a <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzQrdrxZPpXZSWo-E3\"><strong>Nothic</strong></a> —an insane subterranean monster that hungers for flesh. The creature, lured by a faint magical effect emanating from the crevasse, was occupying the area when the Redbrands moved in. Iarno managed to strike a bargain with the monster, convincing it to help guard the stronghold in exchange for treasure and the occasional gift of fresh meat. Still, the nothic is untrustworthy.<br><br>The nothic lurks near the west ends of the two bridges. If it notices intruders entering the cave, it hides behind one of the large stone columns and watches them, attempting to use its Weird Insight (see the creature’s stat block) to discern the characters’ secrets.<br><br>The nothic communicates using telepathy. If detected, it prefers to negotiate and isn’t above betraying the Redbrands for the right incentive, such as the promise of food. When roleplaying the nothic, consider speaking in whispers and throwing in some mad cackles and bits of gibberish. Also be sure to mention that the creature isn’t actually talking but rather filling the characters’ heads with its foul murmurings and demands for food. The nothic knows everything the Redbrands know; see the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw3rch_MTp5N9LObxd6\">What the Redbrands Know</a> handout.<br><br><strong><em>Bridges:</em></strong> These bridges are made of wooden planks and have no rails. The south one is rigged to collapse when a creature weighing more than 50 pounds moves across it. A character next to the bridge can discern that the construction is faulty with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any creature can use an action to dislodge one end of either bridge, dropping it into the crevasse.<br><br><strong><em>Crevasse:</em></strong> This steep-sided fissure is 5 to 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep. Its rough walls are easily climbed without an ability check. A creature that falls into the crevasse takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and lands prone in a jumble of rubble that is difficult terrain (see pg. 70 under \"Difficult Terrain\" in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rules Handbook</em>).<br><br>The bottom of the crevasse feels unnaturally cold. When viewed with a detect magic spell, the area emanates a faint necromantic aura. The magic causes all organic matter in the crevasse to age and decompose at half the normal rate.<br><br>Currently heaped at the bottom among broken and well-gnawed bones is the half-eaten body of Thel Dendrar, the woodcarver of Phandalin who was murdered by the Redbrands. The outlaws left his corpse here for the nothic to feed on.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The nothic keeps its hoard in a battered wooden chest hidden in a cubbyhole at the bottom of the crevasse, under the north bridge. The chest can’t be seen from the edge of the crevasse, but is obvious to any character who descends into the fissure. The chest contains 160 sp, 120 gp, five malachite gems (15 gp each), two <em>potions of healing</em>, and a <em>scroll of augury</em>.<br><br>The chest also holds a +1 longsword in a silver-chased scabbard. The sword is inscribed with the name “Talon,” and its hilt is worked in the shape of a bird of prey with outspread wings. It once belonged to a great knight named Aldith Tresendar, known as the Black Hawk. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recognizes the sword and recalls this lore.<br><br>Sir Aldith died fighting off the orcs that attacked through the hidden caverns below his manor. Talon was lost here until the nothic found it.<br><br><h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>Divide <strong>450 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the party defeats the nothic or negotiates a truce with it.<br><hr><h3>Area 9 - Guard Barracks</h3>A character who listens at this door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check hears several gruff voices issuing demeaning commands in the Goblin tongue. Examples include “Lick the floor!” and “Roll like a dog!” The bugbears here are bullying their goblin slave.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>This barracks contains four roughly built wooden bunks, with heaped-up blankets and dirty dishes scattered about. A strong smell of unwashed bodies and rotten meat fills the air. Three tall, furry humanoids are lounging among the mess, barking orders at a sad little goblin that demeans itself for their amusement. Your sudden appearance causes the goblin to faint.</em></div><br>Three<strong> <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzQoXJiumzgkP6iUHN\">Bugbears</a> </strong>and one <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzOZQmWHzGfufDsoXC\"><strong>Goblin</strong></a> are present. The goblin, Droop, falls unconscious at the sight of the party, but another creature can use an action to wake him. Otherwise, Droop remains unconscious for 1d10 minutes.<br><br>The bugbears work for the Black Spider and were sent here to help Iarno keep the Redbrands and the citizens of Phandalin in line. The leader is named Mosk. He wears a jeweled eye patch even though he has both his eyes. Mosk wears the eye patch because he thinks it’s fancy.<br><br>The bugbears avoid the human members of the Redbrands. If the characters are wearing scarlet cloaks taken from elsewhere, the bugbears assume that they serve Iarno. Clever characters might even persuade the bugbears to help deal with “traitors” or “impostors” elsewhere in the dungeon. If you don’t think the players are doing a great job roleplaying the deception, you can have the character who is doing most of the talking make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check to convince the bugbears to do what the party wants.<br><br><h4>Roleplaying Droop</h4>The goblin, Droop, is not a threat to the party. He has been cowed by the bugbears and follows their orders until someone stronger comes along.<br><br>If he regains consciousness during combat, Droop hides and avoids the fight. He is such a coward that if he is ordered to fight, he does so with <em>disadvantage</em> (as explained on pg. 57 of the Basic Rules handbook).<br><br>Droop knows the general layout of the Redbrand hideout, as well as the location of its secret doors and traps. He doesn’t think to offer up the information, but if prompted, he reveals as much as he can remember in an attempt to be useful to the party. Some of the details might be confusing or mixed up. He is a goblin, after all.<br><br>If the bugbears are dispatched, Droop tries to ingratiate himself with the party. He doesn’t remember the route to Cragmaw Castle, but he knows it’s up north, in the forest. He also knows that Cragmaw goblins patrol around Phandalin, and he suggests the characters might be able to capture a patrol to learn more about the castle.<br><br>Characters might be inclined to keep Droop around for a while. See the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-grGjgAZqwUGRr-lJ\">Playing NPC Party Members</a> handout for advice on how to run Droop as a member of the party.<br><br><h4>Developments</h4>The bugbears are the only ones in the Redbrand hideout who know the location of Wave Echo Cave. They won’t willingly divulge this information, since they fear the Black Spider more than they fear the characters.<br><br>The bugbears also know the location of Cragmaw Castle, but again, they don’t share this information readily. A character who interrogates a captured bugbear can pry the information loose with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Mosk carries a belt pouch containing 33 sp and wears an eye patch made of black leather set with semiprecious stones (50 gp). He also has an iron key that locks and unlocks all the doors in the Redbrand hideout.<br><br><h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>Divide <strong>600 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the party defeats the bugbears.<br><hr><h3>Area 10 - Common Room</h3>This area serves as the headquarters and meeting room for the Redbrands. When there is no official business to discuss, it doubles as a common room where the stronghold guards can relax while off duty.<br><br>A character who listens at the door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check hears the villains within engaged in a game of knucklebones. This makes for a mysterious rattling sound, followed by shouts and groans and a sudden gabble of voices as wagers are paid. If the characters burst into the room, they automatically surprise its occupants.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>Several worn tables and chairs are scattered around this large room. Wooden benches are drawn up against walls decorated with draperies of brown and red, and several ale kegs are propped up and tapped.<br></em><em><br></em><em>Four tough-looking human warriors wearing scarlet cloaks are gathered around one of the tables. A stack of coins and trinkets is heaped upon the tabletop between them.</em></div>Four <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzQsgtxep5jqofMX2H\">Redbrand Ruffians</a> are drinking and playing knucklebones when the characters enter. The game isn’t far from turning acrimonious, as most of them do. The dice are loaded, and the ruffian to which they belong is naturally winning. All four have been drinking heavily, and they are poisoned (see \"Appendix A: Conditions\" in the Basic Rules handbook for the effects of being poisoned).<br><br>The Redbrands immediately recognize characters wearing scarlet cloaks as impostors. However, fast-talking characters might still be able to pass themselves off as “new recruits,” especially if they offer to join the game. If you don’t think the players are doing a great job roleplaying the deception, you can have the character who is doing most of the talking make a DC 10 Charisma (Deception) check to fool the Redbrands.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The wealth in the room is all on the table, having been bet in the game. (Knocking over the table or mixing up all the enemies’ loot is a great way to distract them for a short time.) The total amounts to 75 cp, 55 sp, 22 ep, 15 gp, and a gold earring set with a tiny ruby (30 gp).<br><br><h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>Divide <strong>400 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the party defeats the Redbrands in this room.<br><hr><h3>Area 11 - Wizard’s Workshop</h3>Faint bubbling and dripping sounds can be heard through either door of this room with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>This room appears to be a wizard’s workshop. A rat scurries across the floor and takes refuge under a large worktable set up with alembics, retorts, distillation coils, and other alchemical devices, all of it stewing and bubbling away. Bookshelves are crowded with sheaves of parchment and strange-looking tomes.</em></div>Iarno has left his rat familiar here to watch for intruders. The rat shares a telepathic bond with its master, and it sends a brief warning message to Iarno as soon as it detects intruders. The rat moves at a speed of 20 feet and has AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. If the rat is killed, it disappears.<br><br>If the characters leave the rat unharmed, it follows them around as though curious or hungry. It might even feign affection for a character who feeds it, though it remains absolutely loyal to Iarno.<br><br><strong><em>Books and Notes:</em></strong> Iarno is trying to master the art of brewing potions and concocting alchemical mixtures. The books and notes scattered around the room are basic texts on alchemy. Any character proficient in Arcana can see that Iarno’s apparatus appears to be set up to brew <em>potions of invisibility</em>—not that he has succeeded so far.<br><br>Among the books is a tome written in Dwarvish. The journal of an adventurer named Urmon, it describes the history of the Lost Mine of Phandelver and the Forge of Spells. (Share the information in the first paragraph of the “Adventure Backstory” section of the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-JvyI-m6_KWjFFLueArG\">Campaign Overview</a> if you have not already done so.) In addition, Urmon records that a magic mace named Lightbringer was commissioned by priests of Lathander, the god of dawn, from the mages working with the gnomes and dwarves of the Phandelver’s Pact. The mace was lost when Wave Echo Cave and its mine vanished from history. (Characters might find the mace in <strong>Act 4 : Wave Echo Cave</strong>.)<br><br><h4>Developments</h4>Because Iarno and his rat familiar share a telepathic bond, the mage (in area 12) knows the characters are coming and has time to prepare for them.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Most of the materials in this room have no value, but three small bottles hold rare reagents: mercury, dragon bile, and powdered nightshade. These are worth 25 gp each to an apothecary or alchemist.<br><hr><h3>Area 12 - Glasstaff’s Quarters</h3>If the characters approach this room through the secret passage from Area 7, they can surprise the leader of the Redbrands—Iarno <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VEHrwVtT3SvIfnpJ\"><strong>\"Glasstaff\"</strong></a> Albrek. Otherwise, his rat familiar warns him of any who approach through Area 11, and he flees before the characters arrive.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>The walls of this bedchamber are covered with drapes of scarlet cloth. The furnishings include a small writing desk with matching chair, a comfortable-looking bed, and a wooden chest at the foot of the bed.</em></div>If Iarno is surprised, add the following paragraph:<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>Sitting at the desk is a short, dark-bearded human male in robes, studying a tome. He wears a princely mantle of ermine. A beautiful glass staff leans against his chair, within easy reach.</em></div>If the rat in Area 11 warns him that trouble is approaching, Iarno the evil mage grabs his staff of defense (see the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw8SWa95ai7HSrCkYqp\">Magic Items</a> Handout) and the scrolls in his chest (see the “Treasure” section), and flees through the secret door in the northeast corner of the room. In his haste, Iarno leaves behind a <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw413qQ3e7_qwn6MGFp\">letter</a> from the Black Spider and neglects to make sure the secret door is closed all the way. Characters gain advantage on ability checks made to find the slightly ajar secret door (see \"Advantage and Disadvantage\" on pg. 57 in the Basic Rules handbook). For more information on secret doors, see the “General Features” section at the top of this handout.<br><br>If he manages to escape, Iarno flees to Area 1 (through Areas 7 and 8) and grabs the satchel hidden in the cistern there. If the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzQrdrxZPpXZSWo-E3\"><strong>Nothic</strong></a> is still alive in Area 8, Iarno instructs it to waylay any pursuers. If the characters catch up to him, Iarno quaffs the <em>potion of invisibility</em> in the satchel and flees the hideout. At your discretion, he could reappear later in the adventure.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>At the foot of Iarno’s bed is a sturdy, unlocked wooden chest holding the best pickings of the Redbrands’ loot over the last two months. It contains 180 sp, 130 gp, and a silk pouch containing five carnelians (10 gp each), two peridots (15 gp each), and one pearl (100 gp). It also contains two magic items that Iarno brought with him from Neverwinter: a <em>scroll of charm person</em> and a <em>scroll of fireball</em>.<br>Iarno also wields a <em>staff of defense</em> (see the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw8SWa95ai7HSrCkYqp\">Magic Items</a> Handout).<br><br><h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>Divide <strong>200 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the party slays Iarno Albrek.

You don’t need to be an actor or stand-up comedian to get good drama or humor out of your NPCs, but if you want to ham it up, here’s some advice:<br><br><strong><em>Relax:</em></strong> Don’t worry about impressing your players with your thespian skills (or lack thereof).<br><br><strong><em>Get inside the NPCs’ minds:</em></strong> Imagine how they might react to the characters, and strive to be realistic.<br><br><strong><em>Mug it up:</em></strong> Scowl, smile, snarl, flutter your eyelashes, pout, cross your eyes, rub your hands together—whatever it takes to make your NPCs come to life.<br><br><strong><em>Try different voices:</em></strong> Borrow distinctive speech patterns from real life, movies, and television. Adjust the volume as appropriate. An NPC can be loud, soft-spoken, or something in between.<br><br><strong><em>Keep the game moving:</em></strong> Let the players steer the interactions with the NPCs.<br><br>The characters have no reason to fight ordinary townsfolk. Hence, no game statistics are provided for them. If statistics become necessary, use the commoner stat block to represent an adult NPC of any race.",

If the players choose to have their characters split up, they can cover more ground, but you’ll have to take turns running each interaction for each player. Splitting the party also makes the “Redbrand Ruffians” encounter (<a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-XtdpvoGSfUQPRn87\">Overview of Act 2</a>) potentially more dangerous.<br><br>The following sections detail specific locations in town.<hr><h3>Stonehill Inn</h3>In the center of town stands a large, newly built roadhouse of fieldstone and rough-hewn timbers. The common room is filled with locals nursing mugs of ale or cider, all of them eyeing you with curiosity.<br><br>This modest inn has six rooms for rent (<a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzPYLw3mbAXpmqJTjA\">Sildar Hallwinter</a> takes one). If the characters decide to stay here, see “Food, Drink, and Lodging” in the rulebook for pricing. (The characters’ other alternative for lodging is to camp outside the town, or to persuade a farmer such as <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-Vhs_-q6W7ugYXJRu\">Daran Edermath</a> or <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VfJWjpFfS72eIFw0\">Qelline Alderleaf</a> to let them sleep in a hayloft.)<br><br>The proprietor is a short, friendly young human male named <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VidR6NYV9GVGIN1o\">Toblen Stonehill</a>. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining. The new town offered a good opportunity to become established. Toblen is upset that the Redbrands have been allowed to terrorize the town, and that <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VecoxP4-IzGMDAbc\">Harbin Wester</a>, the townmaster, has done nothing to curtail them. However, he tries not to stir up trouble for fear that the Redbrands might retaliate against his wife and children.<br><br><strong><em>Rumors:</em></strong> Spending a little time in the common room and chatting up the townspeople can provide the characters with a number of good leads to explore in and around town. NPCs present in the Stonehill Inn and the rumors they pass on include:<br><br><ul><li>Narth, an old farmer: “Sister Garaele, who oversees the Shrine of Luck, recently left town for a few days, then returned wounded and exhausted.” (See the <strong>“Shrine of Luck”</strong> section below for more information.)</li></ul><br><ul><li>Elsa, a gossipy barmaid: “Daran Edermath, the orchard keeper, is a former adventurer.” (See the<strong> “Edermath Orchard”</strong> section below for more information.)</li></ul><br><ul><li>Lanar, a miner: “Orc raiders have been seen on the east end of Triboar Trail. The townmaster is looking for someone to run them off.” (See the <strong>“Townmaster’s Hall”</strong> section below for more information.)</li></ul><br><ul><li>Trilena, the innkeeper’s wife: “Thel Dendrar, a local woodcarver, stood up to the Redbrands a tenday ago when they came by his shop and leered at his wife. The ruffians murdered him. Several townsfolk saw it happen. The Redbrands grabbed his body, and now his wife, daughter, and son have gone missing too.” (Unknown to Trilena and the other townsfolk, the Redbrands took Thel’s wife and children to their secret hideout.)</li></ul><br><ul><li>Pip, Toblen’s young son: “Qelline Alderleaf’s son Carp said he found a secret tunnel in the woods, but Redbrands almost caught him.” (See the <strong>“Alderleaf Farm”</strong> section below for more information.)</li></ul><br><ul><li>Freda, a weaver: “The Redbrands hassle every business in town, except for the Phandalin Miner’s Exchange. They don’t want trouble with Halia Thornton, who runs it.” (See the <strong>“Phandalin Miner’s Exchange”</strong> section below for more information.)</li></ul><br>These leads should point the characters toward opportunities for adventure in and around Phandalin. In addition, any NPC at the inn can tell the characters that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house at the east end of town—and that the ruffians are trouble.<hr><h3>Barthen’s Provisions</h3>Barthen’s is the biggest trading post in Phandalin. Its shelves stock most ordinary goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. The place is open from sunup to sundown. Barthen’s does not stock weapons or armor, but characters can purchase other adventuring gear here, with the exception of items that cost more than 25 gp. (For prices, see \"Adventuring Gear\" on pg. 48 in the <a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules\"><em>Player's Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rules</em></a>.) Characters in need of weapons or armor are directed to the Lionshield Coster (see that section).<br><br>The proprietor is <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-ViEkvTWyQ4cul36r\">Elmar Barthen</a>, a lean and balding human male shopkeeper of fifty years with a kindly manner. He employs a couple young clerks (Ander and Thistle) who help load and unload wagons, and who wait on customers when Barthen isn’t around.<br><br><strong><em>Delivering the Supplies:</em></strong> If the characters began play with Gundren's adventure hook, their orders are to deliver the wagon of supplies to Barthen’s. Barthen pays the agreed amount (10 gp to each character) and takes possession of the wagon and its supplies. If the characters tell him of Gundren Rockseeker’s capture, Barthen is saddened by the news and encourages the party to find and rescue the dwarf. He considers Gundren a friend and was excited by talk of discovering the lost mine of the Phandelver’s Pact in the nearby hills. If the party hasn’t already learned details of the mine from <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzPYLw3mbAXpmqJTjA\">Sildar Hallwinter</a>, a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check can relate the information from the first paragraph of the “Adventure Backstory” section at the start of the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-JvyI-m6_KWjFFLueArG\">Adventure Overview</a>.<br><br>Barthen also mentions that two more Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden, are camped somewhere outside town. Barthen hasn’t seen them in a tenday and expects the brothers to return “any day now” to resupply. What Barthen doesn’t know is that Tharden is dead and Nundro is a prisoner in the mine. See the <strong>Act 4: Wave Echo Cave</strong> section, for more information.<br><br><strong><em>Barthen’s News:</em></strong> If the characters ask Barthen how business is going, the shopkeeper tells them that the Redbrands are making it hard on everyone, shaking down local businesses and flouting the townmaster’s authority. If the characters seem of a mind to do something about it, he tells them that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house.<hr><h3>Edermath Orchard</h3>Daran Edermath is a retired adventurer who lives in a tidy little cottage beside an apple orchard. A fit, silver-haired half-elf well over a hundred years old, Daran is a fighter who served as a marshal and herald for many years in the lands of the Dragon Coast, far to the southeast. Upon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his original home.<br><br>Daran is a member of the <em>Order of the Gauntlet</em>, a devout and vigilant group that seeks to protect others from the depredations of evildoers. The order is always vigilant, ready to smite evil, enforce justice, and enact retribution against any who try to subjugate or harm others. Though he is no longer active in the order, he keeps an eye on happenings around Phandalin. He is happy to trade news with fellow adventurers, especially those who appear to hold to these virtues.<br><br>Daran is concerned about the Redbrands, and he would like to see a group of adventurers teach the ruffians a lesson. He tells the characters that it’s time someone took a stand against the Redbrands’ leader, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VEHrwVtT3SvIfnpJ\">Glasstaff</a>. Daran knows the Redbrands hang around the Sleeping Giant tap house, but he can also tell the characters that the main Redbrand safe house lies under Tresendar Manor, the ruin at the east edge of town. (See the “Tresendar Manor” section below for more information.)<br><br><strong><em>Quest - Old Owl Trouble:</em></strong> Daran has heard stories from prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that someone is digging around in the ruins known as Old Owl Well. More disturbingly, several prospectors have reported being chased from the area by undead. He asks the characters to visit the ruins, a couple days march northeast of Phandalin, and find out who’s there and what they’re up to. Daran knows that the ruins are an old watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril, and he worries that dangerous magic might be dormant there. If the party pursues this quest, see “Old Owl Well” in <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-Y4QCn2TkoI8ca84l\">Act 3: The Spider's Web</a>.<br><br><h4>Joining the Order of the Gauntlet</h4>If the party deals with the Redbrands and investigates Old Owl Well, Daran Edermath privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the <em>Order of the Gauntlet</em>. He speaks with those who exemplify the virtues of the order, such as honor and vigilance. If a character agrees, Daran awards the person the title of <em>Chevall</em>.<hr><h3>Lionshield Coster</h3><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>Hanging above the front door of this modest trading post is a sign shaped like a wooden shield with a blue lion painted on it.</em></div>This building is owned by the Lionshields, a merchant company based in the city of Yartar, over a hundred miles to the east. They ship finished goods to Phandalin and other small settlements throughout the region, but this outpost has been hard hit by banditry. The most recent Lionshield caravan due in Phandalin never arrived. (It was attacked and its cargo captured by the Cragmaw goblins.)<br><br>The master of the Phandalin post is a sharp-tongued human woman of thirty-five named <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VhULocFxC8Ptd3D8\">Linene Graywind</a>. She knows that bandits have raided Lionshield caravans, but she doesn’t know who is responsible.<br><br>In a back room, Linene keeps a supply of armor and weapons, all of which are for sale to interested buyers. (For prices, see \"Armor and Shields\" and \"Weapons\" in chapter 5 of the <a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules\"><em>Player's Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rules</em></a>.) Linene has a few scruples, however, and won’t sell weapons to anyone she thinks might be a threat to the town. Among those with whom she refuses to do business are the Redbrands. She warns the characters that the ruffians are trouble and advises them to avoid the Sleeping Giant tap house.<br><br><strong><em>Recovered Goods:</em></strong> If the characters return the stolen goods found in Area 8 of the Cragmaw Hideout (or if they left the goods but reveal where they can be found), Linene gives them a reward of 50 gp and promises to help the adventurers any way she can.<hr><h3>Phandalin Miner’s Exchange</h3>The Miner’s Exchange is a trading post where local miners have their valuable finds weighed, measured, and paid out. In the absence of any local lord or authority, the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to various streams and excavations around the area. There isn’t any real gold rush in Phandalin, but enough wealth is hidden in the nearby streams and valleys to support a good number of independent prospectors.<br><br>The exchange is a great place to meet people who spend a lot of time out and about in the countryside surrounding Phandalin. The guildmaster is an ambitious and calculating human woman named <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-Vh5XegLfxMNE2V7z\">Halia Thornton</a>. In her attempts to establish the Miner’s Exchange as the closest thing the town has to a governing authority, she acts as more than a simple merchant. She is also an agent of the Zhentarim, a powerful organization that seeks to exert secret control over the North through wealth and influence. Halia is working slowly to bring Phandalin under her control, and can become a valuable patron to the characters if they don’t cross her.<br><br>Halia doesn’t know the location of Cragmaw Castle, but she has heard that the Redbrands have a goblin minion serving them. She suggests the goblin might know the location. She leverages this information to try to persuade the characters into helping her deal with the Redbrands.<br><br><strong><em>Quest - Halia’s Job Offer:</em></strong> If approached by characters she believes she can control, Halia explains that the Redbrands are a problem. She tells how the ruffians loiter around the Sleeping Giant tap house and have a base under Tresendar Manor, on the east edge of town. She then offers the characters 100 gp to eliminate the Redbrand leader, whom the outlaws call <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VEHrwVtT3SvIfnpJ\">Glasstaff</a>, and bring her any correspondence found in the leader’s quarters. Halia doesn’t reveal that she wants to take over the Redbrand operation herself. A DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check indicates she has ulterior motives for wanting the Redbrand leader dead.<br><br><h4>Joining the Zhentarim</h4>If the party disposes of the Redbrand leader, Halia Thornton approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the <em>Zhentarim</em>. She speaks with those who share the Zhentarim’s pursuits, such as wealth and power. Even if the party wipes out the Redbrand gang, Halia might still extend the offer in an effort to gain friends (and spies) within the party. If a character agrees, Halia gives the individual the title of <em>Fang</em>.<hr><h3>Alderleaf Farm</h3>A wise female halfling of forty-five, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VfJWjpFfS72eIFw0\">Qelline Alderleaf</a> is a pragmatic farmer who seems to know everything that goes on in town. She is a kind host, and is willing to let the characters stay in her hayloft if they don’t want to stay at the Stonehill Inn.<br><br><strong><em>Carp’s Story:</em></strong> Qelline’s son, Carp, is a spirited and precocious halfling lad of ten years. He is enchanted by the idea of being an adventurer and says that he was playing in the woods near Tresendar Manor when he found a secret tunnel in a thicket. A couple of “big ugly bandits” came out of the tunnel when he was there, and met with a pair of Redbrands. They didn’t see him, but it was close. Carp thinks that the bandits have a secret lair under the old manor house. He can take the characters to the tunnel or provide them with directions to the location. The tunnel leads to Area 8 in the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw3Knuas-tb23yOSyUn\">Redbrand Hideout</a>.<br><br><strong><em>Quest - Reidoth the Druid:</em></strong> Qelline is a longtime friend of a druid named Reidoth. If she figures out that the characters are looking for specific sites in the area, such as Cragmaw Castle or Wave Echo Cave, she suggests that they visit Reidoth and ask for his help, “since there’s not an inch of the land he doesn’t know.” She tells the characters that Reidoth recently set out for the ruins of a town called Thundertree, just west of the Neverwinter Wood. The ruins are about fifty miles northwest of Phandalin, and she provides directions so the characters can easily find the place. If the party pursues this quest, see “Ruins of Thundertree” in <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-Y4QCn2TkoI8ca84l\">Act 3: The Spider's Web</a>.<hr><h3>Shrine of Luck</h3>Phandalin’s only temple is a small shrine made of stones taken from the nearby ruins. It is dedicated to Tymora, goddess of luck and good fortune.<br><br>The shrine is in the care of a scholarly acolyte named <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VeyusJsRJ__UBxoV\">Sister Garaele</a>, a zealous young elf who despairs of ever ridding Phandalin of the Redbrands. Sister Garaele is a member of the <em>Harpers</em>, a scattered network of adventurers and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power. The Harpers gather information throughout the land to thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group that grows too strong. They aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed. Sister Garaele regularly reports to her superiors on events in and around Phandalin.<br><br><strong><em>Quest - The Banshee’s Bargain:</em></strong> Recently, Garaele’s superiors asked her to undertake a delicate mission. They wanted her to persuade a banshee named Agatha to answer a question about a spellbook. Garaele sought out Agatha in her lair, but the creature did not appear for her.<br><br>Garaele desires an intermediary to bring Agatha a suitable gift, a jeweled silver comb, and persuade the creature to tell what she knows about the location of a spellbook belonging to a legendary mage named Bowgentle. Sister Garaele believes that a character who flatters Agatha’s vanity might be able to trade the comb for an answer. She offers the quest to the characters and offers them three potions of healing as payment for their efforts. If the party pursues this quest, see \"Agatha's Lair\" in <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-Y4QCn2TkoI8ca84l\">Act 3: The Spider's Web</a>.<br><br><h4>Joining the Harpers</h4>If the party helps Garaele learn the fate of Bowgentle’s spellbook, the elf privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the <em>Harpers</em>. She speaks with those who exemplify the virtues of the network and possess a desire to enact positive change through information and secrecy. If a character agrees, Sister Garaele awards the individual the title of <em>Watcher</em>.<hr><h3>The Sleeping Giant</h3>This rundown tap house is a dirty, dangerous watering hole at the end of Phandalin’s main street. It is frequented by Redbrand thugs and operated by a surly female dwarf named Grista. If the characters choose to visit the place, run the “Redbrand Ruffians” encounter in the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-XtdpvoGSfUQPRn87\">Overview of Act 2</a>.<hr><h3>Townmaster’s Hall</h3><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>The townmaster’s hall has sturdy stone walls, a pitched wooden roof, and a bell tower at the back. Posted on a board next to the front door is a notice written in Common. It reads: “REWARD—Orcs near Wyvern Tor! Those of a mind to face the orc menace should inquire within.” The notice bears the town’s seal and an indecipherable signature.</em></div>Phandalin has no functioning government, but the townsfolk elect someone to serve as townmaster each year. The townmaster serves as a judge in minor disputes and keeps any records that need to be kept. The current townmaster is a male human banker named <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VecoxP4-IzGMDAbc\">Harbin Wester</a> —a fat, pompous old fool. Completely intimidated by the Redbrands, he claims that they’re “just a mercenary guild, and not all that much trouble, really.”<br><br>The townmaster’s hall has a small but serviceable jail in the cellar. The jail consists of two cells, and Harbin carries keys to the cell doors.<br><br><strong><em>Quest - Orc Trouble:</em></strong> Harbin is looking for someone to head east on the Triboar Trail, where travelers have reported trouble with a band of orcs near Wyvern Tor. He offers 100 gp to any group that can take care of the problem. If the party pursues this quest, see “Wyvern Tor” in<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-Y4QCn2TkoI8ca84l\">Act 3: The Spider's Web</a>.<br><br><strong><em>Quest - Finding Cragmaw Castle:</em></strong> After resting at the Stonehill Inn, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzPYLw3mbAXpmqJTjA\">Sildar Hallwinter</a> establishes himself at the townmaster’s hall. As an agent of the <em>Lords’ Alliance</em>, his goal is to bring law and order to Phandalin. As such, he wants to find the lost mine of Wave Echo Cave and help <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-UvenWLnM2QvyP9a6\">The Rockseeker Brothers</a> put it back into production, believing that bringing prosperity to the region will help civilize the town.<br><br>Sildar also encourages the characters to keep up the pressure on the Cragmaw goblins. He offers the party a 500 gp reward if they can locate Cragmaw Castle and defeat or drive off the tribe’s chieftain. Sildar suggests the party might find the castle by searching the lands around the Triboar Trail for more raiding parties (see “Wilderness Encounters” in the “Triboar Trail” section of the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw-Y4QCn2TkoI8ca84l\">Overview of Act 3</a>).<br><br><strong><em>Quest - Finding Iarno:</em></strong> After questioning several locals, Sildar learns that Iarno Albrek, a fellow member of the <em>Lords’ Alliance</em>, disappeared while exploring the area around Tresendar Manor about two months ago, shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar asks the characters to investigate the manor and the surrounding area to find and bring back Iarno—or what’s left of him, if something killed him. Sildar describes Iarno as “a short, dark-bearded human wizard in his thirties.”<br><br>Unknown to Sildar, Iarno created the Redbrands, installed himself as their leader, and took the alias <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Jw-VEHrwVtT3SvIfnpJ\">Glasstaff</a> to conceal his identity. (The Redbrands call him that because he carries a glass staff.) Once he learns the truth about Iarno, Sildar expresses a desire to have the wizard captured and transported to Neverwinter to face the judgment of a higher authority. Regardless of Iarno’s fate, Sildar rewards the party with 200 gp for eliminating the Redbrand threat.<br><br><h4>Joining the Lords’ Alliance</h4>If the party eliminates the goblin threat from Cragmaw Castle or uncovers Iarno’s treachery, Sildar Hallwinter privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the <em>Lords’ Alliance</em>. He speaks with those who exemplify a desire for the security of civilization through action. If a character agrees, Sildar Hallwinter awards the individual the title of <em>Cloak</em>.<hr><h3>Tresendar Manor</h3>More a castle than a house, Tresendar Manor stands at the east edge of town on a low hillside amid woods and thickets. The ancient manor has long been abandoned, but its cellars have been converted into a Redbrand stronghold. If the characters investigate this place, they find the entrance to the Redbrand hideout.<br><br>Venturing into the Redbrand Hideout is a dungeon crawl onto itself and is covered in detail in the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw3Knuas-tb23yOSyUn\">Redbrand Hideout Map Guide</a>.<br>",

Agatha’s lair is a few miles outside town.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>The forest grows dark and still as the trail winds deeper into the trees. Heavy vines and thick layers of moss drape the branches, and the air is noticeably colder than it was in the ruined village. Rounding a bend in the trail, you see a screen made from the warped branches of trees standing close together, woven into a domelike shelter in the shadows. A low doorway leads inside.</em></div>If the characters exercise caution and remember what they’ve come for, they will be able to speak with the banshee. When the characters enter the shelter, read the following:<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>A home of sorts is sheltered within the dome of woven branches.

The doors are reinforced with heavy iron bands, and thick shutters protect the windows.</em></div><br>Reidoth is a gaunt, white-bearded human who doesn’t use two words when one word will do. Though he receives very few visitors, he is reasonably hospitable.<br><br>Reidoth is adept at staying away from the ash zombies that overrun the village, as well as avoiding the area’s mutated plants. He knows that dangerous spiders lurk in the ruins at the base of the hill, and he suspects that someone is hiding out on the eastern side of town—he’s seen “folk in black masks and cloaks” (the cultists) skulking around. However, he is currently most concerned by the fact that a green dragon has moved into the tower (Area 7) since the last time he was here. He warns the characters of all these threats, and suggests that they leave Thundertree before they get themselves killed.<br><br><h4>Developments</h4>If the characters ask about Cragmaw Castle, Reidoth gladly provides directions. He is a member of the Emerald Enclave, a widespread group of wilderness survivalists who preserve the natural order while rooting out troublesome threats. The enclave works to restore and preserve the natural order by keeping the elemental forces of the world in check, preventing civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another, and helping others survive the perils of the wilds. The goblins are a threat to the delicate balance.<br><br>If the characters ask Reidoth about Wave Echo Cave, he will not divulge its location but will offer to guide the party there in exchange for a favor: he wants them to chase off the dragon in area 7. If they succeed, Reidoth will honor his part of the agreement but will not accompany the party inside the mine.<br><br>If the characters attack him for any reason, Reidoth transforms into a gray squirrel and scurries out of the cottage through a crack in the wall. He vanishes into the woods, then waits for the hostile characters to leave. His watch post contains nothing of value.<br><br><h4>Joining the Emerald Enclave</h4>If the party helps Reidoth by chasing off Venomfang, the druid privately approaches certain members of the group and urges them to join the <em>Emerald Enclave</em>. He speaks with those who exemplify the ideal of protecting the natural order. If a character agrees, Reidoth gives the individual the title of <em>Springwarden</em>.<br><br><hr><h3>Area 5 - Blighted Farmhouse</h3>To its south, this farm abuts a field with thick patches of gorse and briars.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>This ruin looks as if it might once have been a farmhouse.</em></div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>It is now half swallowed by a dense thicket, with trees growing up through its ruined foundations.

Any disturbance in the ruined farmhouse (for example, characters rooting around in the rubble) draws the blights’ ire.<br><br>Each round for 3 rounds, two twig blights head for the south doorway leading into the farmhouse while two more head for the north doorway. The blights attack until destroyed.<br><br><h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>Divide <strong>200 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the party destroys the twig blights.<br><br><hr><h3>Area 6 - Ruined Store</h3>This former general store is not a complete ruin yet, with portions of its tile roof still intact.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>At an intersection near the middle of the village, a narrow lane winds up the steep hillside to the north. Directly to the south is a ruined building that might have been a store or workshop. Webs stretch across the lane, from the building to the trees on the north side of the road.</em></div>Two <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzZD8JkUqM03mBgjr8\"><strong>Giant Spiders</strong></a> hide on the inner walls in this ruined building, so they are not visible from outside. Trailing lines from the webs in the lane allow the spiders to sense when prey is moving through the webs, at which point they nimbly scuttle over the wall and attack. The alert spiders surprise any character whose passive Wisdom (Perception) score is less than 17.<br><br><strong><em>Webs:</em></strong> The webs fill two squares north of the doorway (and the square marked “6”). They are difficult terrain, and a creature trying to move through them must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failure, the creature is restrained in the web (see \"Appendix A: Conditions\" on pg. 105 of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rules Handbook</em> for the effect of being restrained). A snared creature can take an action each round to attempt to break free with a DC 12 Strength check, or it can try to cut its way free by using a light weapon that deals slashing damage. The webs have AC 10, 5 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage (see “Damage Resistance and Vulnerability” on pg. 75 of the Basic Rules handbook for how vulnerability works).<span style=\"color: rgb( 192 , 80 , 77 )\"></span><br><br>Going around the webs is difficult because of the thickets on the north side of the road. Going around the ruined building to the south leads to the twig blights in Area 5.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The corpse of an unfortunate adventurer is cocooned in spider silk in the western half of the building. The body is shriveled up and sucked dry, but appears to have been a male elf. The body wears studded leather armor and a shortsword in the scabbard at its hip. A careful search also yields a <em>potion of healing</em> in a belt pouch, along with 23 gp and 35 sp.<br><br><h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>Divide <strong>400 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the party defeats the giant spiders.<br><br><hr><h3>Area 7 - Dragon’s Tower</h3>This tower was formerly the home of a human wizard, who was killed fighting the ash zombies that overran Thundertree thirty years ago.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>At the top of the hill stands a round tower with a cottage attached. Both are in good condition, although half of the tower’s roof is gone. A door leads into the cottage, and several arrow-slit windows are visible in the tower. You can’t help but notice an eerie quiet in the area and a strange, acrid smell in the air.<br><br>The corpses of two hideous giant spiders are sprawled near the edge of the pathway, apparently dragged there. Their bloated bodies are puckered and blistered, and appear to have been mauled by a large animal.</em></div>A young green dragon named <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzZOIuyii-y8XQ2yDB\"><strong>Venomfang</strong></a> has recently claimed the tower, having passed over Thundertree while searching Neverwinter Wood for a suitable lair. The giant spider corpses are the former residents of the tower, killed by the dragon after it tore its way through the roof. Since then, Venomfang has been laying low.<br><br><strong><em>Tower:</em></strong> The dragon lives in the tower—a single room with a 40-foot-high ceiling. A 5-foot-wide staircase circles the interior, rising to the now-opened rooftop that allows the dragon easy access to its new home. Heavy wooden beams and stair supports crisscross the tower interior.<br><br>Venomfang does not want to give up such a promising lair, but if the characters reduce the dragon to half its hit points, it climbs to the top of the tower and flies off to fight another day.<br><br><strong><em>Cottage:</em></strong> The cottage contains dusty furniture draped in webbing, but nothing of value. If the characters make a lot of noise in the cottage, the dragon hears them and steels itself for a fight.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>An old wooden chest broken open on the tower floor holds the last of the dead wizard’s treasure: 800 sp, 150 gp, four silver goblets set with moonstones (60 gp each), a <em>scroll of misty step</em>, and a <em>scroll of lightning bolt</em>. Venomfang spends much of his time greedily admiring the loot.<br><br>The dragon has barely noticed the most interesting item in its hoard. Beneath the coins is a rusty old battleaxe of dwarven manufacture. Runes in Dwarvish on the axe head read, “Hew,” and the rust is misleading. Hew is a +1 battleaxe that deals maximum damage when the wielder hits a plant creature or an object made of wood. The axe’s creator was a dwarf smith who feuded with the dryads of a forest where he cut firewood. Whoever carries the axe feels uneasy whenever he or she travels through a forest.<br><br><h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>Divide <strong>2,000 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the party drives away Venomfang. Given their level, the characters aren’t likely to slay the dragon, but it is worth <strong>3,900 XP</strong>.<br><br><hr><h3>Area 8 - Old Smithy</h3>This smithy was abandoned long ago.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>A wide chimney and rotted piles of firewood jumbled outside the walls of this sagging building suggest that it was a smithy in its day.</em></div><br>Two <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KqivtUGlpOt5XGG2j9l\">Ash Zombies</a></strong><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"> </span>are slumped on the floor.

However, a small wooden case is hidden in a compartment beneath the storage shelves. A character searching through the wreckage can find the case with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The check succeeds automatically if Mirna sent the party to find the heirloom.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The case is worthless but contains a gold necklace with a fine emerald pendant (200 gp).<br><br><h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>Divide <strong>200 XP</strong> equally among the characters if the party returns the necklace to Mirna instead of keeping it.<br><br><hr><h3>Area 10 - Town Square</h3>Encroaching underbrush has yet to engulf the square.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>On the east side of town, the lane opens up to form a small square. Several ruined buildings surround the south side of the square, but a larger, intact structure to the north looks like a barracks.

In the middle of the square, leaning to one side ever so slightly, is a weathered wooden statue of a warrior clutching a spear and shield.</em></div>The leaning statue is ten feet tall, including the base. It depicts an old hero of Neverwinter named Palien, who supposedly defeated several monsters in Neverwinter Wood when Thundertree was first founded. A character who studies the statue recognizes the depiction with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check. The statue can be knocked over with a successful DC 20 Strength check.<br><br><hr><h3>Area 11 - Old Garrison</h3>For the residents of Thundertree, living so close to Neverwinter Wood demanded constant vigilance.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>The barracks appears to have weathered the years better than most buildings in town.

The chamber to the north contains two double bunks, while the chamber to the south has three double bunks, providing quarters for ten soldiers altogether.

People traveling along the Triboar Trail in the vicinity of Conyberry catch glimpses of Wyvern Tor to the south as they go. The tor was formerly the home of a large and dangerous nest of wyverns, but a band of bold adventurers dealt with the monsters years ago. Though the wyverns never returned, other creatures lair here from time to time. Wyvern Tor’s current squatters include a band of orcs and their ogre ally.<br><br>The orcs are scouts of the Many Arrows tribe. These orcs often roam into the more civilized areas of the North, spying out human settlements, waylaying travelers, and looting and plundering as opportunities present themselves. Stories of new settlers near Phandalin and renewed traffic along the old Triboar Trail drew this band to the area. Their leader is Brughor Axe-Biter—a savage brute who is more interested in murdering and looting than scouting.<br><hr><h3>Orc Camp</h3>Wyvern Tor is a sizable hill, with miles of rugged terrain on its flanks and slopes.

A noticeable breeze blows through many of its passages, flowing from Area 1 toward Area 16.<br><strong><em><br>Ceilings:</em></strong> Tunnels are 10 feet high unless noted otherwise. Rooms have 20-foot-high ceilings, while natural caverns have 30-foot-high ceilings dotted with stalactites.<br><strong><em><br>Doors:</em></strong> Unless noted otherwise, all doors are 6 feet tall, 4 feet wide, and made of six-inch-thick cut slabs of stone fitted with iron handles and hinges. The doors are low and wide—perfect for dwarves.<br><strong><em><br>Walls:</em></strong> The walls are hewn stone. In a few Areas (14, 15, 19, and 20), they are dressed with well-fitted stone blocks.<br><strong><em><br>Floors:</em></strong> All floors are smooth, natural stone.<br><strong><em><br>Light:</em></strong> None unless otherwise indicated. The boxed text assumes that the characters have light sources or darkvision.<br><br><strong>Stalagmites:</strong> Found in many of the natural caverns, these spires of rock rise up from the floor and can be used for cover (see pg. 74 under \"Cover\" in the <a href=\" Similarly, whenever the adventure text presents a creature’s name in bold type. \"><em>Player's Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rules</em></a>).<br><hr><h3>Area 1 - Cave Entrance</h3>Whether the characters follow Gundren’s map or receive directions to Wave Echo Cave from another source, their initial approach leads them to a narrow tunnel whose entrance is hidden within the Sword Mountain foothills.<br><br>Flavor Text:<br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>The entrance tunnel leads into a large cavern supported by a natural pillar of rock and containing three stalagmites. In the western part of the cave, behind the column of rock, are three bedrolls and a heap of ordinary supplies—sacks of flour, bags of salt, casks of salted meat, lanterns, flasks of lamp oil, pickaxes, shovels, and other gear. Amid the supplies, you see the body of a dwarf miner, dead for at least a week.<br></em><em><br></em><em>The northeastern section of the cavern has collapsed, forming a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-deep pit. A sturdy hemp rope is tied off around a nearby stalagmite and dangles down the side of the pit, at the bottom of which is a rough-hewn tunnel heading northwest and east.</em></div>This was the campsite of the Rockseekers. The dead dwarf is Tharden, Gundren’s brother, who was killed by the Black Spider.

When the party enters this section of the mine, the jelly begins to stalk the group, instinctively waiting for an opportunity to attack a lone target.<br><hr><h3>Area 3 - Old Entrance</h3>The tunnel that runs south was the original entrance to Wave Echo Cave, but it was buried by the destruction that wracked the mines centuries ago.

Centuries of anger have poisoned his soul, transforming him into a hate-filled apparition.<br><br>Mormesk leads the undead that haunt Wave Echo Cave. The wraith spends his time here because the treasure he had amassed in life is in the scorched chest (see the “Treasure” section). No longer corporeal, he cannot touch or possess the wealth he enjoyed in life.<br><br>This building served as a guesthouse for visiting wizards working in the Forge of Spells (Area 15), most of whom were humans from nearby cities. The furnishings are all human proportioned.<br><br><h4>Roleplaying Mormesk</h4>Mormesk speaks in grave whispers. When the wraith first rises up from the floor, it says, “Your presence is offensive to me, your life forfeit. My treasures are mine alone, not yours to plunder!” If the characters make no attempt to reason with the wraith, it attacks.<br><br>If the characters try to reason with the wraith, it listens to what they have to say, provided they have not harmed it in any way or seized any of its property. The wraith is irrevocably evil, so the only way the characters can stay its spectral hand is to offer it something a former wizard would consider valuable in exchange for their lives. Mormesk values magic items (particularly scrolls), spellbooks, and arcane knowledge. Whatever the gift, a character must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the wraith of its value.<br><br>Regardless of what the characters offer it, the wraith won’t relinquish the wooden pipe in the scorched chest. It will, however, part with the coins and gems if the characters agree to kill the spectator in the Forge of Spells. (The wraith doesn’t explain what a spectator is. It merely points toward Area 15.) Once it receives its gift, the wraith allows characters to peruse its books and keep the secret map in one of them (see the “Treasure” section).<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The scorched chest is unlocked and contains 1,100 cp, 160 sp, 50 ep, three diamonds (100 gp each), and a wooden pipe adorned with platinum filigree (150 gp).<br><br>A handful of magically preserved tomes remain on the shelves. Most are just histories, but one has a map sewn into its cover. The map’s presence can be discerned with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The shows the location of a dungeon of your own creation. When the characters finish their explorations here, this old map can lead them to their next adventure.<br><hr><h3>Area 15 - Forge of Spells</h3>Here is where the wizards allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver’s Pact channeled the magic of these caverns to enchant dwarven arms and gnome gadgets. The northernmost door is scorched and cracked, its iron hinges partially melted; forcing it open requires a successful DC 15 Strength check. The western double doors are just as damaged but stand slightly ajar.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>This large workshop was badly damaged by the ancient spell battle that laid waste to the mine. Worktables taking up two corners of the room are scorched, and the plaster has been burned off the masonry walls.

The brazier and its pedestal appear to have been untouched by the forces that destroyed this area.<br><br></em><em>Behind the brazier of green flame floats a spherical creature measuring roughly four feet in diameter. Four eyestalks protrude from its central mass, two on each side.

One of the human wizards who worked in the Forge of Spells summoned the creature to guard the magic items created and stored here. When the mine was sacked, the orcs disturbed the delicate magic in the area, unhinging the spectator’s grip on reality. It has become deranged and believes that the mine is still in use, ignoring all evidence to the contrary.<br><br>The wraith (Area 14) wants to drive off or kill the spectator, but so far, the creature has easily handled the assaults of Mormesk’s zombies and ghouls while seeing nothing strange about undead roaming the mine. If the party attempts to remove anything from this area, the spectator attacks. If the spectator is blinded somehow, it disappears back to its home plane, convinced that it can no longer perform the task for which it was summoned.<br><br>With a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check, a character can trick the spectator into thinking one or more party members are wizards or miners who work for the owners of Wave Echo Cave, sent to terminate the spectator’s employment. If the deception succeeds, the spectator believes it is released from its obligations, and it disappears and returns to its home plane.<br><br><strong><em>Brazier of Green Flame:</em></strong> A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies the brazier as the source of the magic that suffuses the surrounding caverns. This magic has waned over the years, to the extent that it can no longer be harnessed to permanently enchant magic items. However, any nonmagical weapon or armor bathed in the green flame for at least 1 minute becomes a +1 weapon or +1 armor, respectively, for 1d12 hours (see <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Jw8SWa95ai7HSrCkYqp\">Magic Items</a>). The brazier cannot be removed from the Forge of Spells.<br><br><strong><em>Northern Room:</em></strong> This small room is a separate workspace, where items being prepared for enchantment were polished, lacquered, and otherwise finished. Like the main workshop, it has been almost completely destroyed.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>On the worktable in the southeast corner of the room are the last items the spectator was charged to protect: <em>Lightbringer</em> and <em>Dragonguard</em>.<br><br><strong><em>Lightbringer:</em></strong> This +1 mace was made for a cleric of Lathander, the god of dawn. The head of the mace is shaped like a sunburst and made of solid brass. Named Lightbringer, this weapon glows as bright as a torch when its wielder commands. While glowing, the mace deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage to undead creatures.<br><br><strong><em>Dragonguard:</em></strong> This +1 breastplate has a gold dragon motif worked into its design. Created for a human hero of Neverwinter named Tergon, it grants its wearer advantage on saving throws against the breath weapons of creatures that have the dragon type.<br><hr><h3>Area 16 - Booming Cavern</h3>The sound of pounding surf that gives Wave Echo Cave its name can be traced to this water-filled cavern.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>A narrow ledge overlooks a large cavern that houses a surging, seething body of water. The rhythmic booming heard throughout the mines is louder here. At regular intervals, a fresh surge of water funnels into this chamber and slams against the wall just below the ledge. The echo suggests that this cave might be one arm of a much larger cavern to the northeast.</em></div>The ledge that hugs the south wall is 15 feet above water level. However, when water surges into the cave every 2 minutes, it raises the water level by 10 feet. After a minute, the water level returns to its normal depth of 20 feet.<br><hr><h3>Area 17 - Old Streambed</h3>The stream flowing from area 10 to Area 18 used to continue through this low passage, eventually emptying out into Area 16.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>This passageway is barely four feet high and is obstructed by rounded boulders and pebbles. It might have been a streambed, though no water flows here now.</em></div>The dwarves diverted the stream into the channel leading to Area 12 to drive the waterwheel in the smelter. Then the earthquakes that rocked Wave Echo Cave during the final spell battle of the orc invasion collapsed the floor in area 18, diverting the stream once again. The old streambed remains as a usable passage that circumvents the undead in Area 12, although Nezznar has not yet discovered this.<br><hr><h3>Area 18 - Collapsed Cavern</h3>Nezznar’s servants occupy this cavern, guarding against undead incursions and carefully sifting through the rubble. The Black Spider’s divinations suggest that some valuable treasure is hidden at the bottom of the rift that was created when this area was destroyed.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>A wide rift fills the eastern half of this cavern. A stream pours out of the west wall, then tumbles down into the rift and flows out again to the north.

Two of them are clearing rock on the rift floor while one more stands guard in the western half of the cavern. A <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-JwJPrh4d_Yq19AdV-a8\">Doppleganger</a></strong> named Vhalak supervises the operation in the guise of a male drow. If a fight breaks out in the main cavern, the two bugbears in the rift climb up the ropes to join the fray.<br><br><strong><em>Rift:</em></strong> The rift is 20 feet deep. Climbing up or down without using a rope requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. A creature that fails the check by 5 or more falls and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the bottom.<br><br><h4>Developments</h4>If two or more bugbears are killed, the doppelganger tries to retreat to Area 19 to warn Nezznar.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Nezznar’s divinations are accurate. Buried under heavy rubble at the bottom of the rift is the crushed skeleton of a dwarf wearing <em>gauntlets of ogre power</em>. The remains are hidden from view but can be found with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Each character searching can attempt one check per hour.<br><hr><h3>Area 19 - Temple of Dumathoin</h3>Nezznar uses this room as his headquarters while he explores the mines and searches for the Forge of Spells.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Flavor Text:</div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><em>Six cracked marble pillars line the walls of this hall, at the north end of which stands a nine-foot-tall statue of a dwarf seated on a throne, a mighty stone warhammer across his lap.

If they are expecting trouble, the spiders hide behind pillars, and Nezznar casts <em>invisibility</em> on himself and stands near the table. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the spiders. When intruders appear, the spiders try to entangle them in webs before closing to melee range. Nezznar joins the fray on the round after the spiders attack.<br><br>If the <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzaeItv6oEpTJ9WaHS\">Doppleganger</a></strong> from Area 18 retreated to this area, it assumes the guise of Nundro Rockseeker so that Nezznar can use the “dwarf” as leverage to force the party’s surrender (although the drow won’t actually harm the doppelganger). See the “Roleplaying Nezznar” section for more information on the drow villain.<br><br><strong><em>Statue:</em></strong> The statue depicts Dumathoin, the dwarven god of mining. Any character who has proficiency in Religion recognizes the deity. The statue is beautifully carved, and its emerald eyes appear extremely valuable. However, the jewels are clever fakes made of worthless glass, as close inspection and a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals. Nevertheless, a powerful spell protects them, and a detect magic spell reveals a strong aura of abjuration magic surrounding the statue.<br><br>A character can climb the statue easily and pry a jewel loose with a successful DC 10 Strength check. However, if either eye is removed, the pillars that line the walls crack, triggering a ceiling collapse. Each creature in the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d10 bludgeoning damage from falling rubble and falling prone on a failure, or taking only half the damage on a success.<br><br><strong><em>Table:</em></strong> The table is strewn with notes and maps showing Nezznar’s efforts at exploring the mine so far. A black leather sack of treasure is amid the papers (see the “Treasure” section).<br><br><h4>Roleplaying Nezznar</h4>Even though he intends to kill the characters, Nezznar is curious about them. Given the chance, he quizzes the characters at length regarding their identities, allegiances, interests, and goals,. He files it all away in memory in the hope that someday he might find a use for what he learns.<br><br>Nezznar admits to being the Black Spider, and to using the Cragmaw goblins and the Redbrands to ensure that Wave Echo Cave remains his secret. He will say or do anything to put the characters off their guard, including promising to surrender or proposing cooperation against the monsters impeding his progress toward reaching the Forge of Spells. However, he betrays the characters as soon as they outlive their usefulness.<br><br><h4>Developments</h4>The creatures in Area 18 can hear sounds of combat in this room. If they haven’t already been dealt with, they arrive after 3 rounds and act immediately after Nezznar’s giant spiders in the initiative count.<br><br>If the characters capture Nezznar and deliver him to the townmaster’s hall in Phandalin, the drow is locked up until <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-JvzPYLw3mbAXpmqJTjA\">Sildar Hallwinter</a> or another representative of the <em>Lords’ Alliance</em> can escort him to Neverwinter to face justice and interrogation.

The Zhents want to learn everything the Black Spider knows about Wave Echo Cave. What happens to Nezznar at that point is up to you.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Nezznar carries a <em>potion of healing</em> and a <em>spider staff</em>. In addition, the drow carries an iron key with a head shaped like an anvil. This key unlocks the door to Area 20.<br><br>Nezznar’s exploration of Wave Echo Cave has yielded some treasure, which the drow keeps in the sack on the wooden table.

            "notes": "Every adventure holds the promise—but not a guarantee—of finding one or more magic items. <em>Lost Mine of Phandelver</em> contains an assortment of magic items that hints at the wider variety of magic items waiting to be found in the worlds of D&amp;D. See the <a href=\"https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/dungeon-masters-guide\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a> for many more items.<br><hr><h3>Using a Magic Item</h3>A magic item’s description explains how the item works. Handling a magic item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about the item. Casting the identify spell on the item then reveals its properties. Alternatively, a character can concentrate on the item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item’s properties. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.<br><br>Certain magic items require a user to attune to them before their magical properties can be used. Attuning to a magic item requires that you spend a short rest concentrating on it (this can’t be the same short rest used to learn an item’s properties). Depending on the nature of the item, this concentration can take the form of prayers, weapon practice, or meditation. In any case, the concentration period must be uninterrupted. Once you are attuned to an item, you can use its magical properties.<br><br>An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time. A creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at any given time, and you can attune yourself to only one item during a short rest.<br><br>Your attunement to an item ends when the item has been more than 100 feet away from you for 24 hours and when you die. You can also voluntarily end your attunement to an item with another short rest.<hr><h3>Item Descriptions</h3><h4>+1 Armor</h4><em>Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare</em><br>The most basic form of magic armor is a superb product of physical and magical craft. You have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class while wearing this armor.<br>A suit of <em>+1 armor</em> never rusts or deteriorates, and it magically resizes to fit its wearer.<br><br><h4>+1 Weapon</h4><em>Weapon (any), uncommon</em><br>Magic weapons are unmistakably finer in quality than their ordinary counterparts. You have a +1 bonus to the attack rolls and damage rolls you make with this weapon.<br><br>Some <em>+1 weapons</em> (swords in particular) have additional properties, such as shedding light.<br><br><h4>Boots of Striding and Springing</h4><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>Your speed while you wear these boots becomes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher, and your speed is not reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor. In addition, whenever you jump, you can jump three times the normal distance.<br><br><h4>Gauntlets of Ogre Power</h4><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>While you wear these gauntlets, your Strength becomes 19. If your Strength is already 19 or higher, the gauntlets have no effect on you.<br><br><h4>Potion of Flying</h4><em>Potion, very rare</em><br>This potion gives you a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. If the potion wears off while you’re flying and nothing else is holding you aloft, you must use your movement to descend. If you fail to land before 1 minute passes, you fall.<br><br><h4>Potion of Healing</h4><em>Potion, common</em><br>When you drink this potion, you regain 2d4 + 2 hit points.<br><br><h4>Potion of Invisibility</h4><em>Potion, very rare</em><br>When you drink this potion, you—along with the clothing, armor, weapons, and other equipment on your person—become invisible for 1 hour. The invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.<br><br><h4>Potion of Vitality</h4><em>Potion, very rare</em><br>Drinking this potion removes any exhaustion you are suffering, cures any disease or poison affecting you, and maximizes the effect of any Hit Die you spend to regain hit points within the next 24 hours.<br><br><h4>Ring of Protection</h4><em>Ring, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>While you are wearing this ring and are attuned to it, you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class and saving throws.<br><br><h4>Spell Scroll</h4><em>Scroll, varies</em><br>A <em>spell scroll</em> bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell’s components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.<br><br>If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.<br><br>Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.<br><br><h4>Spider Staff</h4>The top of this black, adamantine staff is shaped like a spider. The staff weighs 6 pounds. You must be attuned to the staff to gain its benefits and cast its spells.<br><br>The staff can be wielded as a quarterstaff. It deals 1d6 extra poison damage on a hit when used to make a weapon attack.<br><br>The staff has 10 charges, which are used to fuel the spells within it. With the staff in hand, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from the staff if the spell is on your class’s spell list: <em>spider climb</em> (1 charge) or <em>web</em> (2 charges, spell save DC 15). No components are required.<br><br>The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges each day at dusk. If you expend the staff’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.<br><br><h4>Staff of Defense</h4>This slender, hollow staff is made of glass yet is as strong as oak. It weighs 3 pounds. You must be attuned to the staff to gain its benefits and cast its spells.<br>While holding the staff, you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.<br><br>The staff has 10 charges, which are used to fuel the spells within it. With the staff in hand, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from the staff if the spell is on your class’s spell list: <em>mage armor</em> (1 charge) or <em>shield</em> (2 charges). No components are required.<br><br>The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the staff’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff shatters and is destroyed.<br><br><h4>Wand of Magic Missiles</h4><em>Wand, uncommon</em><br>This wand has 7 charges. With the wand in hand, you can use your action to fire the <em>magic missile</em> spell from the wand—no components required—and expend 1 to 3 of the wand’s charges. For each charge you expend beyond 1, the spell’s level increases by 1. You can use this wand even if you are incapable of casting spells.<br><br>The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ash and is destroyed.<br>",

That creature can keep the cage raised allowing any Medium or smaller creatures within to escape. The creature drops the cage if it picks up a different item in either hand or moves away from the cage.

The character uses 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot traveled up the rope. Pulling a tile out of the ceiling requires one free hand and a DC 10 Strength check made as an action. If a PC rolls a natural 1 on their Strength check to pull a tile from the ceiling, that character pulls too hard, loses balance, doesn’t get the tile out of the ceiling and falls 30 feet to the cave floor below taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone.<br><br>Allow players to get creative when the PCs are dislodging the tiles from the ceiling.

For every 10 feet (rounded down) the character falls, it takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage. When a PC falls this way, it falls straight down. For every ledge the character passes along the way, allow them to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, provided the PC has at least one hand free. If the PC succeeds the character grabs onto the edge of the ledge, takes no damage, and stops their fall. The character can pull themself up onto the ledge by climbing as normal.<br><br>The first time a character makes it to the ledge at 40 feet their climb disturbs the nest of winged venomous snakes that live in the side of the cliff. The holes are their way in and out of their nest.

The snakes are panicked and fight until death.

A blue-scaled dragonborn standing 7 feet tall with a greataxe strapped across his back and a muscular frame wrapped in animal skins gives an ear-to-ear smile showing off his fine set of bestial teeth. “Well, come on in then. That climb was draining and the wind is cold. I’ve got plenty of rabbit stew to share, if you’ve got good stories.”</em></span>",

He brings them into his small but warm hut and invites them to sit on the fur-covered floor. He introduces himself as Alcaeus Scaevola, serves them stew, and if any of the characters are visibly injured, Alcaeus is able to cast <a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells%3AMass%20Cure%20Wounds\"><em>cure wounds</em></a> twice (restoring 1d8+3 hit points each time).

If the characters ask about Elaria’s tiles, the hermit becomes sad. He realizes this means his friend is dead. He is guarded about the tiles and wants to make sure the PCs are really as close to Elaria as they say. Before giving them the tiles he asks each PC to tell him a story about a personal interaction they had with Elaria that they believe defined whom The Master really was. There are no wrong answers here. The purpose is to deepen the characters connection to Elaria and prove to Alcaeus they knew the woman well. If a player gives a particularly entertaining or moving answer, give their character inspiration. When each PC has spoken, he hands the tiles over and sends the characters on their way.</span>"

Ask for a volunteer to be the party mapper. It&#x2019;s the mapper&#x2019;s job to listen carefully to your description of each area, noting its size and exits, and to record that information by sketching on a sheet of paper.<br><br><h3>Time of Year</h3><hr>If you would like the characters to have the opportunity to find a fruit, begin the adventure a few weeks before either the summer or winter solstice. Apart from making a piece of fruit available on the Gulthias Tree, choosing a season provides you with additional details to set the scene, which enhances the adventure.<br><br>If you choose summer, the hills are lush with growth, though the heat sometimes grows oppressive. If the characters embark in the winter, temperatures hover just above freezing during the day and plunge below it at night.<br><br><h3>Adventure Hooks</h3><hr>Adventurers can find the Sunless Citadel within a remote and lonely ravine. The characters can be drawn to the dungeon for any of the following reasons. Relate the information below to the players as necessary to get them interested in journeying to the dungeon site.<br><br><h4>Going for Glory</h4>You are eager to make a name for yourself. The legend of the Sunless Citadel is well known locally, and stories indicate it is a place that holds promise for those intent on discovery, glory, and treasure!<br><br><h4>Rescue Mission</h4>Another party of adventurers, locally based, delved into the Sunless Citadel a month past. They were never seen again. Two human members of that ill-fated party were brother and sister, Talgen Hucrele (a fighter) and <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcthr3FJCDs-rfnYJFv\">Sharwyn Hucrele</a> (a wizard). They were part of an important merchant family based in the nearby village of <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcsp3_vYju9uIlPhxk2\">Oakhurst</a>. Kerowyn Hucrele, the matriarch of the family, offers salvage rights to you and your team if you can find and return with the two lost members of her family&#x2014;or at least return the gold signet rings worn by the missing brother and sister. She also offers a reward of 125 gp per signet ring, per character. If the characters bring back the Hucreles in good shape (of good mind and body), she offers to double the reward.<br><br><h4>Solving a Mystery</h4>The goblin tribe infesting the nearby ruins, called the Sunless Citadel, though no one knows why) sells a single piece of magical fruit to the highest bidder in <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcsp3_vYju9uIlPhxk2\">Oakhurst</a> once every midsummer. They&#x2019;ve been doing this for the last twelve years. Usually, the fruit sells for around 50 gp, which is all the townsfolk can bring themselves to pay a goblin. The fruit, apparently an apple of perfect hue, heals those who suffer from any disease or other ailment. They sometimes plant the seeds at the center of each fruit, hoping to engender an enchanted apple tree. When the seeds germinate in their proper season, they produce a twiggy mass of twisted sapling stems. Not too long after the saplings reach 2 feet in height, they are stolen&#x2014;every time. The townsfolk as&#xAD;sume the goblins send out thieves to ensure their monopoly of enchanted fruit. You are interested in piercing the mystery associated with how wretched goblins could ever possess such a wonder, and how they steal every sprouting sapling grown from the en&#xAD;chanted fruit&#x2019;s seed. Moreover, you wish to find this rumored tree of healing, hoping to heal an ailing friend or relative.<br>"

            "gmnotes": "<h2>Sunless Citadel Overview</h2>A dragon cult that valued privacy and defense built the Sunless Citadel on the surface long ago. All record of the cult&#x2019;s name has vanished, though various sources believe that it was associated with the dragon Ashardalon. The cataclysm that killed the cult members sank the fortress at the same time. Because of residual enchantments, much of the structure survived its descent into the earth. With the cultists dead, goblins and other creatures moved in, and they have survived here for hundreds of years.<br><br>The goblins, which belong to the Durbuluk tribe (&#x201C;Dominator&#x201D; in Goblin), once patrolled the area around the ravine to rob passersby. But now, with the Old Road having fallen out of use, the goblins rarely pay much attention to this entrance anymore. Also, a tribe of kobolds has recently moved in to challenge the goblins&#x2019; ownership of the fortress. Both groups are skirmishing as they vie for control, and they&#x2019;re not overly concerned about the possibility of intruders. Thus, the cleft offers the characters a good opportunity to gain entry to the dungeon without attracting attention. (The missing party that came here before did much the same; the rope left tied to the pillar near the ravine is theirs.)<br><br>Though the kobolds (areas 13&#x2013;24) and the goblins (areas 31&#x2013;41) claim the Sunless Citadel as their property, they&#x2019;ve never visited all its chambers. They avoid entering the most secluded parts of the grove level. In the past, they feared that the hidden grove was haunted. With the arrival of <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kct4hy_5RAdtPNdbxDd\">Belak the Outcast</a> twelve years ago, that belief is vindicated. He orders the goblins to distribute the midsummer fruit each year, and the goblins obey him out of fear.<br><br><strong><em>Monsters on Alert.</em></strong> The kobolds and the goblins respond similarly if attacked. Intruders who fall back to take a long rest before dealing with the leaders of an attacked community allow the creatures time to make preparations. Alerted monsters reinforce cleared rooms with forces previously stationed in other rooms. For example, three kobolds from one area 16 could be stationed in area 15 with orders to set an ambush for returning invaders. Or, four goblins from one area 36 could be redeployed to area 32 to guard against another intrusion. Keep track of such changes, so that the characters don&#x2019;t encounter the same kobolds or goblins twice.<br><br><strong><em>Random Treasure.</em></strong> Each regular kobold and goblin is likely to have 2d10 sp, perhaps in the form of various coins and crude jewelry.<br><br><h2>General Features</h2>The following facts about the environment are true unless otherwise noted in a specific area description.<br><br><strong><em>Doors.</em></strong> The doors are wooden or stone.<br><br><strong><em>Light.</em></strong> Beyond area 2, many rooms in the underground dungeon are lightless. Descriptions assume that the characters have a suitable light source and are able to see their surroundings.<br><br><strong><em>Ventilation.</em></strong> All keyed areas contain an adequate air supply. The air is renewed from countless cracks leading to the upper open cavern and the surface. These cracks are too small for any but creatures such as giant rats to navigate.<br>"

The overgrown Old Road winds through rocky downs, near stands of old-growth oak, and past abandoned farms. It is 7 miles from <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcsp3_vYju9uIlPhxk2\">Oakhurst</a> to the Sunless Citadel.<br><br><h2>Ravine</h2><hr><blockquote>The Old Road passes to the east of a narrow ravine. At the road’s closest approach to the cleft, several broken pillars jut from the earth where the ravine widens. Two of the pillars stand straight, but most lean atop sloped earth. Others are broken, and several have apparently fallen into the dark depths. A few similar pillars are visible on the opposite side of the ravine.<br><br>A sturdy, knotted rope is tied to one of the leaning pillars on this side of the ravine.<br></blockquote><br>The ravine runs for several miles in either direction, with an average depth and width of 30 feet.

Someone went to some effort to hide the evidence of the camps from casual scrutiny.<br><br><strong><em>Descending.</em></strong> The rope tied to one of the leaning pillars hangs down into the darkness of the ravine. Judging by its good condition, the rope couldn’t have been tied there any longer than two or three weeks ago. From the edge of the ravine, older and weathered handholds and footholds can be seen carved into the cliff face.

Ledge</h3><blockquote>A sandy ledge overlooks a subterranean gulf of darkness to the west. The ledge is wide but rough. Sand, rocky debris, and the bones of small animals cover it. A rough-hewn stairwell zigs and zags down the side of the ledge, descending into darkness.</blockquote><br>The far wall of the chasm is 250 feet to the west, and the bottom of the subterranean vault is 80 feet below where the characters stand.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Drawn by the occasional animal that accidentally falls into the ravine, three <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsqdF1Z2UAxuPyoB34\"><strong>giant rats</strong></a> lurk in the rubble. They try to hide if they become aware of the characters, and they ambush the first character who arrives on the ledge without being quiet about it.<br><br><strong><em>Investigating.</em></strong> A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals humanoid footprints, as well as rat tracks of unusually large size. The footprints lead down the stairs.<br><br>Among the rubble is an old ring of stones that contains (and is covered by) the accumulated ash of hundreds of fires, though no fire has been lit here for a few years. Inside the ash pile are a few rough-hewn spear tips of goblin manufacture and small animal bones.<br><br><hr><br><h3>2. Switchback Stairs</h3>The 5-foot-wide stairs that descend from area 1 are roughly carved. They aren’t dangerous to traverse, however, except that combat while on the narrow path can be risky. Three small landings lie along the route, the first at 60 feet above the floor in area 3, the second at 40 feet, and the third at 20 feet.<br><br>The characters might be able to see area 3 as they descend.<br><br><blockquote>A fortress emerges from the darkness. The subterranean citadel, though impressive, seems long forgotten, if the lightless windows,cracked crenellations, and leaning towers are any indication. All is quiet, though a cold breeze blows up from below, bringing with it the scent of dust and a faint trace of rot.<br></blockquote><br><hr><br><h3>3. Crumbled Courtyard</h3><br><blockquote>The narrow stairs empty into a small courtyard, apparently the top of what was once a crenellated battlement. The buried citadel has sunk so far into the earth that the battlement is now level with the surrounding floor. That floor stretches away to the north and south, composed of a layer of treacherous, crumbled masonry, which reaches to an unknown depth. To the west looms the surviving structure of what must be the Sunless Citadel. A tower stands on the west side of the courtyard.</blockquote><br>The stone courtyard, surrounded by crumbled masonry, contains a trap and a wooden door.<br><br><strong><em>Masonry Debris.</em></strong> An expanse of crumbled masonry surrounds the entire citadel. Those attempting to cross it immediately note its unsteadiness. The rubble is difficult terrain. Anyone who moves across the debris must make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check for each 10 feet traversed. On a failed check, the character is unable to move. If the check fails by 5 or more, a slab of masonry below the character shifts, dumping the character into a debris-lined cavity. Climbing back out requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check; on a failed check, the victim drops back into the cavity.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Each time a creature falls into a cavity, the noise is 10 percent likely to draw 1d4 <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsqdF1Z2UAxuPyoB34\"><strong>giant rats</strong></a> from the dozens that infest the rubble field. Attracted rats move carefully and stealthily through the rubble to attack.<br><br><strong><em>Hidden Pit.</em></strong> The map shows the location of a concealed trapdoor that covers a 10-foot-square, 10-foot-deep pit. A 2-foot-wide catwalk on the west edge allows access to the door that leads to area 4. It takes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to note the trapdoor’s unmortared edge. Then, a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check lets a character deduce the location of the catwalk and how the pit operates.<br><br>If a creature steps on the trapdoor, the lid flips open, dumping the creature into the pit. With a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, a creature can use thieves’ tools to jam the lid shut. A mechanism resets the trap 1 minute after the door opens, pushing it back into the closed position. The mechanism is in the pit wall under the catwalk. A creature can jam it in the open position with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. If this check succeeds by 5 or more, the mechanism can be permanently disabled if desired.<br><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> The pit contains two goblin skeletons, one goblin that has been dead for about a day, and one live <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsqdF1Z2UAxuPyoB34\"><strong>giant rat</strong></a>. The rat, which slipped into the pit to feed on the fresh goblin but was caught when the trap reset, attacks creatures inside the pit or climbs out to attack those nearby.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The goblin corpse has a scimitar and a shield, as well as 23 sp and 4 gp in a belt pouch.<br><br><hr><br><h3>4. Tower Shell</h3><br><blockquote>This circular area is cobbled with cracked granite, upon which sprawl the bodies of four goblins, apparently slain in combat. One corpse stands with its back against the western wall, the spear that killed it still skewering it and holding it upright. Three wooden doors lead from this area. A hollow tower of loose masonry reaches thirty feet into the air, but the intervening floors and stairs are gone, except for a couple of crumbled ledges.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Bodies.</em></strong> Investigation reveals that the four goblins have been dead for quite a while, and rats have gnawed at them. The bodies have been looted. If someone removes the spear pinning the goblin to the wall, the body slumps to reveal Draconic runes on the wall behind it. Those who know the Draconic language can read the runes as “Ashardalon.”<br><br><strong><em>Secret Door.</em></strong> A trapped secret door leads to area 5. Finding the door requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The door opens by way of a masonry block that also serves as a lever, which can be pushed in on the left side or pulled out from the right.<br><br><strong><em>Needle Trap.</em></strong> If the lever is pulled out, that movement sets off a needle trap. The needle extends 3 inches out of the opening, dealing 1 piercing damage to whoever pulled the lever. Someone who carefully and slowly pulls the lever open can easily see the needle before it strikes. Disabling the needle requires thieves’ tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. If the check fails by 5 or more, the trap goes off, stabbing the character unless the character succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.<br><br><hr><br><h3>5. Secret Pocket</h3><blockquote>This pocket chamber is damp and cold. The skeletons of three long-dead archers slump against rubble-filled arrow slits along the east and south wall.</blockquote><br>The skeletons date back to the time before the citadel plunged into the earth. That calamity killed all three archers, at the same time instilling in them the curse of undeath. If anyone enters this chamber, the three skeletons animate, pinpoints of red fire sparkling in their eye sockets as they rise.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Each skeleton has twenty arrows, 2d10 sp, 1d10 gp, and one <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KcxqYFZehId7kHtnwqY\"><em>+1 arrow</em></a> in a special socket on the quiver. Because the skeletons are mindless, they don’t use the magical arrows.<br><br><hr><br><h3>6. Old Approach</h3><blockquote>The masonry walls of this twenty-foot-wide hall are in poor repair. The far end has collapsed, filling the southern section with rubble. The western wall is in much better shape than the other walls, and it holds a stone door with a rearing dragon carved in relief on it. The door has a single keyhole, situated in the rearing dragon’s open mouth.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Dragon Door.</em></strong> The door that is carved to look like a dragon has a mechanical lock as well as an <em>arcane lock</em> spell cast on it. The Strength (Athletics) check to defeat the arcane lock is DC 30, and the Dexterity check to bypass the magical lock using thieves’ tools is DC 25. Casting a <em>knock </em>spell on the door suppresses the magical lock for 10 minutes, lowering the DCs by 10 during that time. The mechanical lock remains intact if the magical lock is bypassed, requiring another <em>knock </em>spell or the use of the key. The key, which bypasses the magical lock as well as the mechanical one, is in area 21.<br><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> One <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsqdF1Z2UAxuPyoB34\"><strong>giant rat</strong></a> hides in the rubble. The rat attacks anyone who moves to within 5 feet of the edge of the rubble or anyone left alone in this area.<br><br><hr><br><h3>7. Gallery of Forlorn Notes</h3><blockquote>As the door opens, a hissing noise and a puff of dust around the door indicate that the chamber beyond has been sealed for ages. Dust, long undisturbed, covers every surface in this large gallery. The air here is stale.<br><br>Three alcoves are on the north wall, and one is on the south wall. Each alcove contains a dust-covered stone pedestal with a fist-sized crystalline globe resting on it. The globes in the northern alcoves are cracked and dark, but the globe in the southern alcove glows with a soft blue light. Faint tinkling notes issue from it.</blockquote><br>If a character moves within 5 feet of the lit globe, brooding music begins to play throughout the area, and the sound carries into areas 6, 8, and 9 if the doors to those areas are open. Any creature that can hear the music must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the music of the globe for 24 hours. On a failed save, a creature becomes charmed and, while charmed in this way, can take only the Dash action and move toward area 3.<br><br>The effect on a creature ends once that creature reaches the floor beyond the pit trap in area 3. If an affected creature is prevented from moving to area 3, the creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. The effect ends on its own 1 minute after the creature can no longer hear the music. A creature can escape the music by being on the other side of a closed door that leads to the gallery, or by vacating the area (including adjacent rooms) where the music is audible.<br><br>The globe has AC 10 and 10 hit points. If it is attacked or handled, the music becomes louder, audible in areas 4 and 10 if the doors to those areas are open. The DC of the Wisdom saving throw then increases to 20. If the globe is reduced to 0 hit points or taken from the room, it cracks and goes dark and silent. It no longer functions.<br><br><hr><br><h3>8. Pressure Plate</h3><blockquote>The air is stale in this twenty-foot-long corridor, which leads to another closed stone door.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Arrow Trap.</em></strong> Each time any weight is placed on any part of the center 10-foot-square section of the corridor, a mechanical pressure plate is activated, triggering a trap. An arrow fires from above the western door at the creature who triggered the trap: +5 to hit, 5 (1d10) piercing damage.<br><br>With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone around it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or some other similarly sized and sturdy object under the pressure plate prevents it from activating.<br><br><hr><br><h3>9. Dragon Riddle</h3><blockquote>Dust fills this hall like a layer of gray snow. In the rounded northern end of the chamber stands a ten-foot-tall sculpture of a coiled dragon carved from red-veined white marble.</blockquote><br>After reading the\ntext above reveal <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcy_howDnoK03AvavLY\">Handout: Area 9</a> to your players.<br><strong><em><br>Dragon Sculpture.</em></strong> If a creature moves within 5 feet of the dragon statue, a <em>magic mouth</em> spell causes the dragon to utter a riddle in Common (to viewers, it seems as though the stone jaws are actually moving). The dragon’s riddle is as follows:<br><br><em>We come at night without being fetched;<br>we disappear by day without being stolen.<br>What are we?</em><br>(Answer: stars)<br><br><strong><em>Secret Door.</em></strong> A secret door in the western wall leads to area 10. Finding the door requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Under the scrutiny of detect magic, the door radiates a faint aura of abjuration magic. The door comes open, pivoting into the room, only if someone speaks the answer to the riddle.<br><br>Once the door is opened, it closes on its own 1 minute later, although any obstruction placed in the doorway prevents it from doing so. The door can be opened from the western side with a simple push.<br><br><hr><br><h3>10. Honor Guard</h3><br><blockquote>Dust cloaks the contents of this twenty-foot-wide hall. Six alcoves line the walls, three to the north and three to the south. Each alcove except the southwest one holds a humanoid figure carved of red-veined white marble. The figures resemble tall elves in plate armor. A stone archway at the west end of the hall opens into a wide room from which greenish light glows. A dark pit is situated before the archway.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Southwest Alcove.</em></strong> A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the dust in the room is disturbed by tracks that start in the southwest alcove, though the tracks are filled in enough that the disturbance must have occurred dozens of years ago. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check enables a character to determine that the tracks were made by tiny humanoid feet with claw-like nails. They begin in the center of the alcove, move west toward the pit, and then disappear into the pit. A character who enters the pit to follow the tracks must make another successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check to pick up the trail again.<br><br><strong><em>Spiked Pit.</em></strong> The pit is 10 feet deep, and its bottom is filled with spikes that deal 11 (2d10) piercing damage to a creature that falls in, as well as falling damage. The walls of the pit are rough, and they offer handholds to climbers. Area 12 begins on its far side.<br><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> A quasit named <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcsy0pBnzX6geI6zcXC\"><strong>Jot</strong></a> was bound in the southwestern alcove an age ago to guard the contents of the sarcophagus in area 12. It was in suspended animation until a few decades ago, and it now waits on the other side of the arch just out of sight in area 12. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcsy0pBnzX6geI6zcXC\">Jot</a> is alerted by any light source the characters have, so it can prepare for them. (If the characters have no light source and are stealthy, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcsy0pBnzX6geI6zcXC\">Jot</a> might not become aware of them.) The quasit darts out of its hiding place and attacks the first creature that climbs out of the pit on the western side.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcsy0pBnzX6geI6zcXC\">Jot</a> doesn’t fight to the death. If it takes any damage, or if more than one character attacks it, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcsy0pBnzX6geI6zcXC\">Jot</a> laughs and says, “You broke the binding. My watch over the dragonpriest is over!” It uses its next action to become invisible. It then turns into a bat and flies along the 10-foot-high ceiling across the pit.<br><br>If <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcsy0pBnzX6geI6zcXC\">Jot</a> escapes, the characters might see it again. It knows that death on the Material Plane means a return to the Abyss, so it prefers to harass the characters while they are otherwise engaged, laughing and mocking as it does so.<br><br><strong><em>Secret Door.</em></strong> Finding the door on the southern wall requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The door opens with a simple push inward.<br><br><hr><br><h3>11. Secret Room</h3><blockquote>Dust coats the contents of this tiny chamber, obscuring runes inscribed on the southern wall.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Inscription.</em></strong> If the southern wall is cleared of dust, the runes are revealed to be a message in Draconic. Someone who can read the language understands it as “A dragonpriest entombed alive for transgressions of the Law still retains the honor of his position.”<br><br><strong><em>Secret Door.</em></strong> A secret trapdoor in the floor requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. The door opens by pulling it upward. It leads to a 3-foot-by-3-foot crawl space that connects to a similar trapdoor in area 12.<br><hr><br><h3>12. Tomb of a Failed Dragonpriest</h3><blockquote>Violet marble tiles cover the floor and walls, though all are cracked or broken, revealing rough-hewn stone beneath. Sconces are attached to the walls at each corner. One holds a torch that burns with greenish fire. A marble sarcophagus, easily nine feet long, lies in the room’s center. The coffin is carved with dragon imagery, and the head of the sarcophagus resembles a dragon’s head. Rusting iron clasps firmly lock down the lid.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Torch.</em></strong> The greenish fire is a <em>continual flame</em> spell.<br><br><strong><em>Sarcophagus.</em></strong> Six rusted iron latches hold down the sarcophagus lid. Opening a single latch requires a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the six latches are opened, the lid can be removed with a successful DC 15 Strength check or by the effort of any combination of characters whose combined Strength is 30 or higher.<br><br>Inside, a dragonpriest lies imprisoned, kept alive by virtue of a <em>sequester</em> spell that is dispelled with a flash of green light when the sarcophagus is opened. If the characters look inside, read:<br><br><blockquote>In the coffin is a troll! It’s dressed in rotted finery, but its jewelry and rings adorned with tiny silver dragons still sparkle. The creature’s body is shrunken and elongated, and its flesh is a rubbery, putrid green. Its black hair is long, thick, and ropy. Its beady black eyes flash open, and it snarls.</blockquote><br>This dragonpriest delved into magic that the dragon cult deemed profane—he permanently transformed himself from an elf into a troll. For this crime, the cult entombed him alive, though the honor of his station remained. The dragonpriest attacks his rescuers, his mind all but transformed to that of a troll over the ages of his burial. He had a name, but he has forgotten it, although he has not forgotten how to speak Elvish and Draconic.<br><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> In his current state, the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctefgR5EoyKQATPjRo\"><strong>dragonpriest</strong></a> is slower and weaker than a normal troll. Use <strong>troll</strong> statistics, but the dragonpriest starts with 30 hit points, regenerates only 5 hit points per round (up to normal for a troll), and can’t use Multiattack. If he is defeated in this state, the dragonpriest is worth 450 XP.<br>Development. The dragonpriest won’t pursue fleeing characters. Instead, he continues to repose in his tomb until hunger finally draws him forth to hunt five days later. By that time, he uses the normal troll statistics, retaining his additional languages.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The dragonpriest has an ornate ceremonial dagger (worth 125 gp), two silver rings (15 gp each), and a silver amulet (15 gp). Scattered across the bottom of the sarcophagus are 220 sp, 50 gp, and four <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcyj_fsxEF8rpYcpooV\"><em>spell scrolls</em></a>: <em>command</em>, <em>cure wounds</em> (2nd level), <em>inflict wounds</em> (2nd level), and <em>guiding bolt</em> (2nd level).<br><br><hr><br><h3>13. Empty Room</h3>Several empty rooms in the fortress have the same characteristics. Nothing of note can be found in any of them.<br><br><blockquote>This ruined chamber stands empty of all but a litter of rocky debris.</blockquote><br><em><strong>Note:</strong> </em>In areas 13 and beyond, monsters move through the halls. Please refer to the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kd1kVgHb59Lpf6ttBLG\">Random Encounters</a> handout.<br><br><hr><br><h3>14. Enchanted Water Cache</h3><br><blockquote>The stone relief-carved door sealing this chamber portrays a dragon-like fish swimming.</blockquote><br>The door is locked but can be opened with thieves’ tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.<br><br>If the door is opened, read:<br><br><blockquote>This ten-foot-square chamber is hewn from stone. It contains an upright keg fashioned of rusted iron. Rusted pipes lead from the keg into the floor.</blockquote><br>If anyone shakes or strikes the keg, the sound of sloshing liquid comes from inside it. The connecting pipes hold the keg in place, preventing it from being detached. The characters can remove a wide metallic bung on the keg’s top with a successful DC 15 Strength check, or someone can easily stave in the side of the keg.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> If the keg is breached, the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxjzbTHsFUppW6d4u\"><strong>ice mephit</strong></a> and the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxvD8ebSTCbuH32Ab\"><strong>steam mephit</strong></a> confined within it are released. The creatures attack anyone who has disturbed the keg.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Within the keg are five tiny sapphires (worth 10 gp each) used to bring about the magic that bound the mephits.<br><br><hr><br><h3>15. Dragon Cell</h3><blockquote>Crudely executed symbols and glyphs, scribed in bright green dye, decorate this large and irregularly shaped crumbling chamber. A large pit in the center shows evidence of a recent fire. A metallic cage in the middle of the southern wall contains a gaping hole and stands empty. A small wooden bench draped with green cloth is next to the cage, and several small objects rest on it. A bedroll lies near the wooden bench, and the sound of whimpering comes from inside it.</blockquote><br>Until recently, the kobolds confined a white dragon wyrmling in the cage and placed it under heavy guard. Those guards were not strong enough to stand against a sortie by goblins that stole the wyrmling a week ago.<br><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kd2Cj9tOzl_v8JsyLEa\">Meepo</a>, the <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcsxc5SFZfbBe53aZMe\">kobold</a></strong> who was his tribe’s Keeper of Dragons, is now the sole occupant of the chamber. He is heartsick at the loss of the wyrmling and spends much of his time nowadays in nightmare-ridden sleep in his bedroll. With the loss of his charge, Meepo’s status is in the gutter. He doesn’t react to anything short of loud noise or direct prodding.<br><br>If he is disturbed, Meepo is frightened but willing to talk. He is weepy. His numerous obvious scars are souvenirs of his job as Keeper of Dragons. If he is asked about the cage or queried in any way that mentions a dragon, he says, “The clan’s dragon … we lost it. The wretched goblins stole <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyYH11nMrHKaGl9zZ\">Calcryx</a>, our dragon!”<br><br>To all other questions, Meepo responds by saying, “Meepo don’t know, but <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxWG5IBmxv8eq7g6Ug\">Yusdrayl</a> does. Meepo take you to meet <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxWG5IBmxv8eq7g6Ug\">Yusdrayl</a>, our leader, if you make nice. You get safe passage, if you promise to make nice. Maybe if you promise to rescue dragon, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxWG5IBmxv8eq7g6Ug\">Yusdrayl</a> make nice to you, answer questions.”<br><br>Meepo perks up as he senses the possibility of getting the dragon back. True to his word, he guides the characters to area 21. Along the way, he shouts out “Ticklecorn!” (in Draconic) from time to time, explaining that it’s a password that tells other kobolds the characters are friendly. If the characters leave Meepo behind, or if they are antagonistic toward him, the characters don’t learn the password, and all other kobolds are hostile toward the party.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If combat occurs in this chamber, the kobolds in the nearby area 16 are alerted, and they rush out to meet enemies.<br><br><strong><em>Investigating.</em></strong> The symbols on the walls are crudely formed in Draconic and read, “Here There Be Dragons.” The metallic cage is all but destroyed and can’t be used to restrain captives. A search of the cage reveals white scales that someone who has proficiency in Nature or Survival can determine to be from no natural animal. A successful DC 15 check using either skill identifies the scales as those of a white dragon wyrmling. The firepit, if its ashes are sifted, is found to hold charred bits of kobold bones and armor.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The bench serves as a sort of tiny altar. Resting on it are containers of green dye, a paintbrush made of goblin-hair bristles, and four tiny jade figurines of dragons (worth 15 gp each). A thorough search of the firepit and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals another jade figurine.<br><br><hr><br><h3>16. Kobold Guardroom</h3>Three rooms in the fortress serve as kobold guard stations. All have the same characteristics.<br><br><strong><em>Door Trap.</em></strong> The door leading to the room is trapped with a tripwire that the kobolds connect after shutting the door. Hitting this tripwire, 2 inches off the ground stretched between opposite door frames and running up the frame, causes the trap to trigger. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the wire. If a character then succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, the tripwire is cut without triggering the trap. A character can attempt this check using any edged weapon or edged tool in place of thieves’ tools, but does so with disadvantage.<br><br>On a failed Dexterity check, the trap triggers, tipping over a clay pot of offal, garbage, and dragon droppings that falls on any creature in the doorway and splatters in a 5-foot radius. A creature hit by the stuff must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.<br><br>The kobolds release the tension on the tripwire when they exit, meaning that any guardroom that has been vacated can be entered safely.<br><br><blockquote>A small pit of embers, built of broken masonry and portions of shattered stone sculptures, smolders in the center of this chamber. Arrayed around the pit are several small rugs woven of matted hair and dead fungi.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> The room serves as a barracks and guard post for the kobold tribe’s warriors. Three <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcsxc5SFZfbBe53aZMe\"><strong>kobolds</strong></a> stand guard inside, unless they have already come forth to reinforce other kobolds.<br><br>If the characters try to talk and the interaction is successful, the kobolds direct the characters to head toward “<a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxWG5IBmxv8eq7g6Ug\">Yusdrayl</a> on her dragon throne,” giving them simple directions to area 21 and warning them to avoid rousing the ire of Yusdrayl’s elite guards.<br><br><hr><br><h3>17. Dragon Chow</h3><br>A character who approaches the door can smell the stench of what lies beyond. If the door is opened, read:<br><br><blockquote>Rats fill the room, trapped among their own waste. A small half-barrier prevents the rats from easily escaping when the door is open.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> The rats are used as food for the dragon wyrmling that was once stabled in area 15. Since the abduction of the dragon, the kobolds have neglected the rats, and in the meantime the rodents have chewed away the fastenings of the barrier. One round after someone opens the door, the rats knock the barrier over and rush out, attacking as a <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyCi37j6yx6DU9Z1P\"><strong>swarm of rats</strong></a> for 1 round, after which they disperse into the dungeon.<br><br><hr><br><h3>18. Prison</h3><br>Each door that lead to the prison chamber is locked, requiring a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to unlock, and also barred on the outside with an iron rod. If a character attempts to open either door while any kobolds are present, the kobolds warn against doing so. Opening a door in spite of this warning turns the kobolds hostile.<br><br><blockquote>Four small humanoids are shackled by thick, rusted chains attached to a large iron spike set in the floor. Several broken weapons and sundered shields lie in one corner.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Four <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxUiKkjybG9adF0V6\"><strong>goblins</strong></a> are chained here, taken prisoner during the course of several skirmishes. Every so often, the kobolds remove a goblin from the room and ransom it back to the goblins (for a price of 2d10 sp). Those who can’t be ransomed are bound for the kobold cook pot. The goblins whine and cower pathetically if any characters enter the room. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools can open the lock on the chains, or the chains can be broken (Strength DC 20) or sundered (AC 15, 60 hit points).<br><br>The goblins promise anything and everything in exchange for their release, including safe passage for the characters to their chief. The creatures have no power to guarantee their promises, however. In addition, if the goblins are released, any understanding the characters have with the kobolds is voided. Freed goblins flee at the first hint of trouble, and they double-cross their rescuers if threatened by other goblins.<br><br><hr><br><h3>19. Hall of Dragons</h3><br>A double row of relief-carved marble columns march the length of this long, large hall. The worn carvings depict entwining dragons.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> An <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctMCRk9XLQr32k_8Fe\"><strong>elite squad of three kobolds</strong></a> patrols the hall, considering the duty an honor. The guards pay particular attention to the door that leads to area 24, which is along the route traditionally used by goblin raiders. These kobolds react to the character’s presence in the same way as the ordinary ones described in area 16. If the characters head for area 21 without causing hostilities, these guards follow the characters into Yusdrayl’s presence.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If combat erupts here, the result is likely to be deadly for the party. Any kobolds remaining in the areas nearby enter the room as reinforcements. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxWG5IBmxv8eq7g6Ug\">Yusdrayl</a> and her two guards arrive from area 21 at the start of the second round of combat. At the start of the fifth round, the kobolds in the area 16 to the southwest of this room come on the scene. At the start of the eighth round, the kobolds from area 23 enter the fray. (Kobolds that leave their original area and are slain here should be noted for possible future reference.)<br><br><hr><br><h3>20. Kobold Colony</h3><br>The strong wooden door that leads to the kobolds’ living quarters is barred from the inside. Characters who give the proper password (“Ticklecorn!” spoken in Draconic; see area 15) or who make a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check can convince the kobolds within to unbar the door. Otherwise, the kobolds open the door only when guards return to the room for a shift change.<br><br><blockquote>Several small but smoky fires light this wide and high chamber. Spits, tanning racks, and other implements of a primitive culture are visible through the haze. Several small figures busily work and play within the chamber.</blockquote><br>Twenty-four kobolds occupy the room, but only three <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcsxc5SFZfbBe53aZMe\"><strong>kobolds</strong></a> are capable warriors that challenge unescorted intruders. Seven other kobolds are <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyziMOLFvlp1gJaxt\"><strong>kobold commoners</strong></a>. The other tribe members here are too young, too old, or too cowardly to defend themselves; they flee if combat breaks out and are worth no XP. Even the kobolds capable of fighting run away if they are outmatched.<br><br>The kobolds here answer all questions with a quick “<a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxWG5IBmxv8eq7g6Ug\">Yusdrayl</a> knows.”<br><br>An attack on these kobolds brings reinforcements, as described in area 19, though each group arrives 1 round later because of the extra distance it must traverse.<br><br><hr><br><h3>21. Dragon Throne</h3><br><blockquote>A short throne stands near the west wall, constructed of fallen bits of masonry stacked against an old altar. On the top of the altar sit a variety of small items. The portion of the altar that serves as the throne’s back features a carving of a rearing dragon. A metallic key is held firmly in the dragon’s open jaws.</blockquote><br>After reading the text above reveal <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kd2CAeVDV0mcPG-TzY3\">Handout: Area 21</a> to your players.<br><b style=\"font-style: italic\"></b><br><b style=\"font-style: italic\">Creatures.</b> Normally sitting on the throne is the kobolds’ leader, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxWG5IBmxv8eq7g6Ug\"><strong>Yusdrayl</strong></a>. Two <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctMCRk9XLQr32k_8Fe\"><strong>elite kobolds</strong></a> guard her. Those who come to Yusdrayl’s chamber can talk to her; she is hostile only if she knows that the characters have slain other kobolds. Characters who antagonize her while talking earn the leader’s ire and a savage attack.<br><br><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxWG5IBmxv8eq7g6Ug\">Yusdrayl</a> can speak to the following questions:<br><br><em>Why are kobolds in this place?</em> “Kobolds are heir to dragons. As the mightiest among my people, I have led a brave few to this ancient holy site, where dragons were worshiped long ago.” <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxWG5IBmxv8eq7g6Ug\">Yusdrayl</a> knows nothing else about the history of the fortress, except the name of the dragon that was once revered here, which is Ashardalon.<br><br><em>What about the goblins/fruit/Belak?</em> “The Outcast, he lives below. He grows the fruit, which he gives to the goblins. The dragon-thieving goblins are his servants!”<br><br><em>What about the twig monsters?</em> “The twig blights are pets of the Outcast. They are more numerous below, in the Twilight <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kdim6hRqLOoA00A4sfR\">Grove</a>.”<br><br><em>What about the lost human adventurers?</em> “They went to fight the goblins and never returned.”<br><br><em>What about the stolen wyrmling dragon?</em> “The goblins stole our dragon! If you return <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyYH11nMrHKaGl9zZ\">Calcryx</a> to us, I shall grant you a reward. Meepo can accompany you if you desire.”<br><br>If the characters decide to go looking for the dragon, the kobolds direct them toward the passage that connects area 15 and area 25, which is the “back way” into goblin territory. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxWG5IBmxv8eq7g6Ug\">Yusdrayl</a> and her followers know nothing useful about the goblin lair. If the characters take Meepo with them, he can serve as their guide to that location. If Meepo goes along and is slain, the kobolds count it as a small loss as long as the dragon is rescued.<br><br>Possible rewards include the key in the carved dragon’s mouth, or any two of the items on the altar. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxWG5IBmxv8eq7g6Ug\">Yusdrayl</a> is also willing to sell the key for 50 gp.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If hostilities break out, reinforcements arrive in the manner described in area 19.<br><br>If the characters return <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyYH11nMrHKaGl9zZ\">Calcryx</a>, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxWG5IBmxv8eq7g6Ug\">Yusdrayl</a> can be convinced to aid them in an assault on the remaining goblins. You determine the nature of the aid.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The key clenched in the mouth of the carved dragon opens the door to area 7. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxWG5IBmxv8eq7g6Ug\">Yusdrayl</a> has keys to area 18 and the chains there, a key to the doors in area 24, and a key that once fit the cage in area 15. She also has 35 gp.<br><br>The items assembled on the altar include a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KcxwIrukDDaAvjzwBDp\">Quaal’s feather token</a> (tree)</em>, three <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcyj_fsxEF8rpYcpooV\">spell scrolls</a> (mage armor, spider climb, and knock)</em>, and a small flask that contains three doses of<em> <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcxraj9aUq_6j-4cuAO\">elixir of health</a></em>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>22. Larder</h3><br><blockquote>The odor of rotting meat permeates this chamber. Most of the rusty iron hooks in the ceiling are empty, but a few hold the skinned carcasses of large vermin, huge fungoid stalks, and several massive insect carapaces. On a small, battered bench along the south wall are pieces of nearly useless cutlery and rusting skinning knives.</blockquote><br>The kobolds bring food for their tribe up from the Underdark and store it in a nearby chamber. The rotting flesh is that of rats, bats, overlarge cave crickets, beetles, goblin parts, and spiders. The room also has a selection of fungi and mushrooms.<br><br><hr><br><h3>23. Underdark Access</h3><br><blockquote>The floor is partially collapsed on the east side of this room, revealing a tunnel. The passage is unworked, and it fluctuates widely in width, height, and direction as natural tunnels do. Within the room, hunting gear is racked on the wall, and several pallets lie nearby.</blockquote><br>The kobolds used the natural passage to first enter the Sunless Citadel, and they continue to travel through it for hunting and gathering forays into the Underdark.<br><br>The tunnel leads beyond the scope of this adventure, but it could be a route to a site you have designed.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> If they have not come forth as reinforcements, three <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcsxc5SFZfbBe53aZMe\"><strong>kobolds</strong></a> camp here, serving as hunters and guardians of the tunnel. They react as described in area 16.<br><br><hr><br><h3>24. Trapped Access</h3><br>The doors on both ends of the corridor are locked and can be opened by a character who succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.<br><br><blockquote>At the other end of a twenty-foot-long corridor is another closed door.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Hidden Pit.</em></strong> The map shows the location of a concealed trapdoor. A 2-foot-wide catwalk along the pit’s center allows safe passage over the pit. With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notices the door’s unmortared rim. After that, a character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check deduces the location of the catwalk, as well as how the pit operates.<br><br>If a creature steps on the pit cover, the lid flips open, dumping the creature 10 feet into the pit. With a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, a creature can use thieves’ tools and an object, such as an iron spike, to wedge the lid shut.<br><br>Kobolds regularly check the trap and manually reset it when necessary.<br><br><hr><br><h3>25. Empty Chamber</h3><br><blockquote>Two empty chambers in the eastern end of the fortress have the same characteristics.</blockquote><br>This empty chamber is home only to rat droppings, crumbled flagstone, and stains.<br><br><strong><em>Investigating.</em></strong> A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices tracks in the dust. Some tracks were made by rats and some by humanoids. A character who then succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check ascertains that the rat tracks are very recent, maybe a day old, and that the humanoid tracks are almost a month old and were made by three or four human-sized humanoids moving across the area to the north.<br><br><strong><em>Trap.</em></strong> The door that connects the northernmost empty chamber with area 31 contains a trap. See area 31 for more details.<br><br><hr><br><h3>26. Dry Fountain</h3><br><blockquote>Dust and odd bits of stony debris and rubble lie scattered on the floor. An ornate fountain is built into the eastern wall. Though cracked and stained, the fountain’s overarching carving of a diving dragon retains its beauty. A relief-carved stone door stands on the western wall.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Investigating.</em></strong> The debris and dust covering the floor display the same tracks described in area 25.<br><br><strong><em>Fountain.</em></strong> A thin layer of scum coats the fountain’s basin, but it is otherwise dry. Under the scrutiny of a <em>detect magic</em> spell, the fountain emits an aura of conjuration. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices a mostly worn-away inscription in Draconic on the basin’s front. It reads, “Let there be fire.”<br><br>If a character speaks the phrase aloud, the magic of the fountain functions one last time. Reddish liquid begins to well from the diving dragon’s mouth, slowly accumulating in the basin. If the liquid is collected, it can be used as a <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kd2NStlptEEcMZ9IkBY\"><em>potion of fire breath</em></a>. After it is used in this way, the fountain loses its magic.<br><br><strong><em>Western Door.</em></strong> Carvings on the western door show skeletal dragons. A Draconic inscription on the door reads, “Rebuke the dead, open the way.” Within 5 feet of the door, the air is noticeably cooler, and the door itself is cold to the touch.<br><br>The locked door opens only when someone targets it with a <em>knock </em>spell or an effect that turns undead. If someone does so, the door glows ghostly blue and swings open silently.<br><br><strong><em>Scythe Trap.</em></strong> If someone tries to open the door without first deactivating the lock, a scythe blade springs forth, targeting the area immediately in front of the door: +5 to hit, 4 (1d8) slashing damage.<br><br>The blade is concealed in a slot in the ceiling, 10 feet up. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check can find the slot before the trap is sprung.<br><br>The opening, once discovered, can be blocked with an iron spike or a similar object. A character who does so must make a DC 15 Dexterity check or Strength check. On a failed check, the blockage falls out when the trap is sprung. Alternatively, a character can use thieves’ tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check to pull the trap mechanism out of the slot and dismantle it. Either task takes about a minute.<br><br><hr><br><h3>27. Sanctuary</h3><br><blockquote>Five dusty sarcophagi, three to the north and two to the south, stand on end in this silent chamber. Each of the carved stone coffins resembles a noble, elf-like humanoid in ceremonial robes. An altar, with images of dragons carved into its black obsidian, is set in the center of the west wall. A single candle burns brightly on the altar. Next to the candle are a small whistle and a crystal flask.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Five <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcsy9qE5hxsGszkww9J\"><strong>skeletons</strong></a> emerge en masse from the sarcophagi to attack those who disturb the altar or open any sarcophagus. These creatures pursue characters who flee.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The candle has a <em>continual flame</em> spell cast on it. In the flask is a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcxt5ImvTSfvuVcxQd1\">potion of resistance</a> </em>(fire). The whistle, made of crystal, has the name <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KcxnaX0qmfihDpwmdk6\"><em>Night Caller</em></a> inscribed on it in Dwarvish. A secret compartment in the shrine, requiring a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, holds a coffer containing six peridot jewels carved in a likeness of a dragon (worth 10 gp each).<br><br><hr><br><h3>28. Infested Cells</h3><br><blockquote>This section of hallway contains six doors, all slightly ajar. The area smells musky.</blockquote><br>The doors lead to small cells. Each door is open just wide enough to enable Small and smaller creatures to slip through without having to open it farther.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> The two southernmost cells and the one to the northeast contain abandoned giant rat nests. One <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsqdF1Z2UAxuPyoB34\"><strong>giant rat</strong></a> lives in each of the other cells. Any noise or light in the area attracts all three creatures.<br><br><strong><em>Investigating.</em></strong> A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices tracks in the dust here. Some tracks were made by rats and some by humanoids. A character who then succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check ascertains that the rat tracks are recent, perhaps a few minutes old, and the humanoid tracks are almost a month old and were made by four human-sized individuals moving across the area to the north. Only three of those individuals returned south.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The occupied rat nests contain shiny bits collected by their current owners. Poking through each nest turns up 2d6 − 2 sp, 1d6 − 1 gp, and 1d4 − 1 gems (worth 5 gp each).<br><br><hr><br><h3>29. Disabled Traps</h3><br><blockquote>The cobblestone floor contains two trapdoors blocked open by iron spikes. The north wall holds a dry fountain carved with an overarching diving dragon. A faint rotten stench pervades the room.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Investigating.</em></strong> The two marked areas on the map are traps that were jammed open by the lost adventuring party. Examining each one reveals a 20-foot-deep pit containing only rat bones, rusted metal bits, and filth.<br><br>Chances to find or follow the trail noted in area 28 are similar here. The trail of the missing adventuring party skirts around the traps and leads to the western wooden door.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> Those who spend more than 3 rounds in the chamber conversing in normal tones, or otherwise making noise, draw the attention of the inhabitants of area 30, who hide to ready an ambush.<br><br><strong><em>Trapped Fountain.</em></strong> The dry fountain on the northern wall looks remarkably like the one described in area 26. Under the scrutiny of a <em>detect magic</em> spell, the fountain emits a faint aura of evocation. A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals suspicious metallic tubes in the carved dragon’s mouth, as well as a small, rusted iron canister. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices a mostly worn-away inscription in Draconic on the front of the basin. It reads, “Let there be death.”<br><br>Anyone who speaks this phrase aloud in Draconic triggers the trap. A poison mist sprays forth from the dragon’s mouth, filling a 20-foot cube and expending the canister’s last charge. Those in the area must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5 (1d10) poison damage and becomes poisoned for 10 minutes. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute.<br><br><strong><em>Western Door.</em></strong> A character who approaches the western door can smell the stench of rotten meat coming from the other side.<br><br><hr><br><h3>30. Mama Rat</h3><br><blockquote>An oppressive smell suffuses the air, rising from chewed carcasses of cave rats, smaller vermin, and a few humanoid-looking creatures. The bodies lie upon a floor of filth, old bones, hair, and fur that combine to make a particularly large and vile nest.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Investigating.</em></strong> The humanoid corpses in the chamber include two goblins, a kobold, and one human male—a member of the lost adventuring party (Karakas the ranger).<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Three <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsqdF1Z2UAxuPyoB34\"><strong>giant rats</strong></a> occupy the area, along with a monstrously swollen female diseased giant rat that the goblins call <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxPZfrtLOjhgHo8lm\"><strong>Guthash</strong></a> (Bloated One). The giant rats that hunt in the Sunless Citadel all descend from her. These creatures attack and attempt to eat all trespassers.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Poking through the refuse over a period of 10 minutes uncovers 312 sp, 68 gp, and 3 gems (worth 25 gp each). On and around the ranger’s corpse are several items: studded leather armor, five daggers, a longbow, a backpack (containing a water skin, one day’s rations, a bedroll, a tinderbox, and three torches), a quiver with six arrows, a <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcxrpz8v1Mx_omuWugh\"><em>potion of healing</em></a>, and a pouch that holds 17 gp. A gold ring (worth 10 gp) on Karakas’s finger is engraved (in Common) with his name.<br><br><hr><br><h3>31. Caltrop Hall</h3><br>The door that leads north into this hallway is closed and fitted with a bell that clangs if someone opens the door without doing so very slowly.<br><br>With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, someone who carefully opens the door might spot the bell attached to the door about 3 feet off the ground. A character who examines the space around the door before opening it and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the damage done to the door when the goblins fastened the bell to it.<br><br>If the bell rings, the noise alerts the goblins in area 32. They duck behind the low wall and wait to ambush intruders that enter the corridor.<br><br><blockquote>The ten-foot-wide hall is liberally strewn with sharp caltrops. On the northern wall, passage to the room beyond is partially blocked by a roughly mortared, three-foot-high wall, complete with crenellations.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Caltrops.</em></strong> The floor in the hallway is strewn with caltrops; see “<a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules%3AAdventuring%20Gear/\">Adventuring Gear</a>” in chapter 5 of the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Two <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxUiKkjybG9adF0V6\"><strong>goblins</strong></a> in area 32 pop up over the wall if they are alerted to the characters’ presence. The creatures use ranged attacks as the characters move through the hall.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> About two hundred caltrops are strewn on the floor.<br><br><hr><br><h3>32. Goblin Gate</h3><br><blockquote>The filth on the floor, stains on the walls, shabby hides, and firepit attest to the years of use this room has seen at the hands of creatures unconcerned with hygiene. On the eastern side of the southern wall is a crudely mortared half-wall, complete with crenellations.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Two <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxUiKkjybG9adF0V6\"><strong>goblins</strong></a> are stationed behind the rough, 3-foot-high wall. They are hostile to intruders, but unwilling to die facing a superior force. If captured, these goblins know the same information that <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyfS5ufBWNFxG48nT\">Erky Timbers</a> in area 34 does.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If one of the goblins gets away, it warns the goblins in area 33. The alerted goblins prepare an ambush for intruders in that area.<br><br><strong><em>Investigating.</em></strong> A search of the room turns up putrid jerky, vinegary wine in poorly preserved water skins, and other worthless bits of clutter.<br><hr><br><h3>33. Practice Range</h3><br>The sound of goblins engaged in target practice might be heard from outside any of the doors to the practice range.<br><br><blockquote>Dozens of blunted and broken arrows lie on the cracked cobblestone floor, and a few protrude from three crudely sewn, human-sized targets hung along the center of the south wall. The northern third of the room is separated from the south by a crudely mortared and crenellated half-wall. A permanent camp of sorts lies north of the wall, complete with a fire ring and several small iron cook pots.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> The three <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxUiKkjybG9adF0V6\"><strong>goblins</strong></a> assigned to watch the room spend some of their time shooting at the hair-and-fur-filled burlap dummies that look vaguely like humans and elves. The rest of the time they drink too much goblin wine.<br><br>When fighting, the goblins try to use the 3-foot-high wall for cover while shooting their foes.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> One goblin has a silver flask of dwarven make (worth 50 gp) filled with vile goblin wine. Another goblin has a key to open the locked door to area 34.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If things go badly for the goblins, one of them attempts to warn the goblin warriors in area 39.<br><br><hr><br><h3>34. Goblin Stockade</h3><br>The wooden door is closed and locked. It can be opened by a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.<br><br><blockquote>Squalor reigns in this low-ceilinged room. A large iron spike is driven into the floor near the door, and a small iron cage is set farther back. Several sets of corroded manacles are connected to the walls,and some still bind a few crumbling skeletons.</blockquote><br>After reading the text above reveal <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kd7WfZn0XnGKUSBbts1\">Handout: Area 34</a> to your players.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Three <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcsxc5SFZfbBe53aZMe\"><strong>kobolds</strong></a> are bound with crude rope to the iron spike. A battered gnome lies in the cage, which is almost too small for him. It’s easy to untie the kobolds. Freeing the caged gnome requires either a successful DC 15 Strength check to bend the bars or a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to open the cage lock.<br><br>The kobolds are aware that the goblins might try to ransom them back to the other kobolds. Uncertain of their chances with the characters, the kobolds are unhelpful and reluctant to be set free. If they are released and shown a clear line of retreat, the kobolds flee. They know very little, but they react positively to Meepo’s presence or if they are told that the characters intend to free <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyYH11nMrHKaGl9zZ\">Calcryx</a>.<br><br>The gnome is named <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyfS5ufBWNFxG48nT\">Erky Timbers</a>. </strong>If he is released, he helpfully answers questions. He knows the following information:<br><br><em>Why are you here?</em> “Months past, I was on my way to seek my fortune and took the Old Road. My bad luck that the goblin bandits caught me; I’ve been here ever since. My deity’s blessings have kept me healthy; otherwise I’m sure I’d be dead from starvation and abuse.”<br><br><em>What about the goblins/Belak?</em> “I’ve heard the goblins talk about the Twilight <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kdim6hRqLOoA00A4sfR\">Grove</a> down below. A wicked old human called Belak—a spellcaster, I suspect—tends an enchanted garden and harvests fruit from something the goblins call the Gulthias Tree, but they speak of it only in the most terrified of whispers. The enchanted fruit grows on the Gulthias Tree.”<br><br><em>What’s the deal with the fruit?</em> “The midsummer fruit restores spirit and vigor to those who eat it; the pale midwinter fruit steals the same. Belak allows the goblins to sell the fruit on the surface, but I don’t know why.”<br><br><em>What about the twig blights?</em> “Twig blights live in the level below, with the Gulthias Tree.”<br><br><em>What about the lost human adventurers?</em> “The goblins caught three of them over a month ago, and they were captives with me in here for a while. They said their names were Talgen, Sharwyn, and <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxSoDY1CKyuwZyBWIq\">Sir Braford</a>. The goblins kept them in here only about a week before they removed them. Belak wanted them, and that’s the last I’ve heard about that.”<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If the characters fail to suggest it, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyfS5ufBWNFxG48nT\">Erky Timbers</a> asks to join the party as a temporary member. The gnome serves as a loyal friend. Currently, though, he has no gear. Those who free Erky gain XP as if they defeated him in combat.<br><br><strong><em>Manacles.</em></strong> The rusted iron restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. If the characters are taken prisoner (see area 36) and bound here, escaping from the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. A set of manacles can be broken with a successful DC 20 Strength check, or a character proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the lock on a set of manacles with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have AC 15 and 15 hit points.<br><br><hr><br><h3>35. Trapped Corridor</h3><br><strong><em>Hidden Pit.</em></strong> The map shows the location of a concealed trapdoor. A 2-foot-wide catwalk along the pit’s center allows safe passage over the pit. With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notices the door’s unmortared rim. After that, a character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check deduces the location of the catwalk, as well as how the pit operates.<br><br>If a creature steps on the pit cover, the lid flips open, dumping the creature 10 feet into the pit. With a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, a creature can use thieves’ tools and an object, such as an iron spike, to wedge the lid shut.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If characters fall into the pit or otherwise make excessive noise, the goblins in the area 36 to the north are alerted. Alerted goblins respond in 2 rounds. These goblins also check the trap and manually reset it.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check made while searching around the pit uncovers a long-lost gold ring with an inset sapphire (worth 25 gp).<br><br><hr><br><h3>36. Goblin Bandits</h3><br>Three rooms in the northern part of the fortress serve as living quarters for goblin bandits. All have the same characteristics.<br><br><blockquote>The stench, garbage, and carrion here are evidence of years of use by unsanitary tenants. Tattered hides stretched on frames form six unstable hammocks around a much-used firepit. Battered cooking equipment is mixed indiscriminately with broken or worn arms and armor.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Three <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxUiKkjybG9adF0V6\"><strong>goblins</strong></a>, who proudly call themselves bandits, are in the room when the characters enter. In better times, two or more bandit groups would hunt the Old Road together, preying on travelers. Now, the bandits content themselves with an occasional hunt in the wilds of the Underdark (see area 43), as well as preying on the kobolds.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> The goblins might try to knock the characters unconscious and imprison them in area 34, locking victims into manacles. They take captured equipment to the goblin chief in area 41. The bandits are likely to try to ransom the prisoners to someone in <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcsp3_vYju9uIlPhxk2\">Oakhurst</a>. Kerowyn Hucrele is prepared to pay such a ransom, taking it out of the characters’ prospective reward.<br><br>If things go badly for the goblins, one of them attempts to warn the goblin warriors in area 39.<br><br><strong><em>Investigating.</em></strong> A search of the room turns up putrid jerky, vinegary wine in poorly preserved water skins, and worthless bits of clutter.<br><br><hr><br><h3>37. Trophy Room</h3><br>Both of the wooden doors that offer access to the trophy room are closed and locked. Either door can be opened by a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.<br><br><blockquote>Mounted and stuffed animal heads adorn the walls. The mounting job is sloppy, and the assortment of heads includes cattle, rats, and other not particularly impressive specimens. A few grisly trophies share the wall with the animals, including a couple of kobold heads. Smashed and broken cabinets and small tables litter the periphery of the room, mute victims of some sort of rampage. A rusted iron spike stands in the center of the room, trailing a broken chain. Thin patches of frost coat sections of the walls, floor, and debris.</blockquote><br>After reading the text above reveal <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kd7fahxiIhvwz6WnmKW\">Handout: Area 37</a> to your players.<br><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyYH11nMrHKaGl9zZ\"><strong>Calcryx</strong></a>, the white dragon wyrmling, is initially out of view, resting behind a broken table. The goblins used the iron chain to bind her, but she broke free and rampaged through the room, destroying the floor displays. Balsag, the bugbear responsible for capturing the dragon, hasn’t returned to bring her under control, and the other goblins fear to enter.<br><br>The wyrmling finds her current situation superior to her station as the kobolds’ pet. She is hostile to those who enter this chamber. If battle breaks out and Meepo accompanies the party, the dragon targets him first.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The wyrmling has scoured the room and gathered all items of worth into a nest she made behind the table. The valuables include a dragon-shaped, jade figurine (worth 20 gp), a crystal goblet (5 gp), and twenty-four pieces of fine silverware (1 gp each).<br><br>Of particular note is a sealed scroll case carved of bone, carrying an inscription. Runes in the Dwarvish alphabet spell out the word “Khundrukar.” An old parchment is within the case. Age and water damage have destroyed most of it, but a short message in Dwarvish remains: “… the remaining few. By order of Durgeddin the Black, we have created a secret dwarven redoubt. None shall find us; however, …” Though the information makes little sense, even to most dwarves, the case and the parchment can fetch up to 100 gp if sold in a dwarven community.<br><br><hr><br><h3>38. Goblin Pantry</h3><br><blockquote>The north and south walls of this chamber are stacked halfway to the ceiling with ill-made barrels, boxes, and crates. A clear path allows easy access between the west and east doors.</blockquote><br>The goblins store water, wine, and food, none of which is of good quality, in a pantry accessible through two doors. The stockpile includes five pints of oil, along with a few small barrels labeled “Elf Pudding” in <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxUiKkjybG9adF0V6\">Goblin</a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>39. Dragon Haze</h3><br><blockquote>Several torches mounted in crude sconces burn fitfully around this chamber, filling the air with a haze. A double row of marble columns carved with entwining dragons runs the length of the hall.</blockquote><br>As long as the torches burn, the hall is lighted, but the haze makes the area lightly obscured. The haze never builds to suffocating levels, thanks to natural ventilation.<br><br>Any loud noise in the chamber attracts the attention of goblins in the area 36 to the south, as well as in area 40. The goblins in area 40 prepare for danger but don’t leave their stations, while those in area 36 come to investigate within 2 rounds.<br><hr><br><h3>40. Goblinville</h3><br>Anyone who stands within 10 feet of a door leading to the goblins’ main living area can hear the voices of the goblins inside, unless they have been alerted to danger.<br><br><blockquote>What might once have been a cathedral is now a goblin lair, thick with the filth of years of goblin life. Scores of wall- and floor-mounted sconces filled with violet-glowing fungi provide illumination. Dozens of goblins go about their daily business, which involves a lot of rudeness and violence. Along the southern wall is a heaping pile of assorted items, including wagon wheels, broken armor and rusted arms, chests, small statues, antique furniture, and artwork.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Thirty-four goblins are at home when the characters arrive, but only four of the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxUiKkjybG9adF0V6\"><strong>goblins</strong></a> are warriors. Ten of the other goblins are <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kd9-Cxq3v9K76O0k5Uq\"><strong>goblin commoners</strong></a>. The other twenty creatures are noncombatants, too feeble or too fearful to defend themselves; they try to flee through the northernmost or the eastern exit. This stampede should dominate the first moments of battle, and even the goblins capable of fighting refuse to stick around just to lose their lives. Noncombatants are worth no XP.<br><br>These goblinoids know the same information, in cruder form, that Erky in area 34 knows.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> An attack on the goblins brings reinforcements from area 36 and warns the goblin chief in area 41 that something is amiss. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctGUU7CdW46_n4ooWV\">Grenl</a>, the goblin shaman in area 41, might emerge to protect the tribe.<br><br><strong><em>Investigating.</em></strong> The goblins collect the phosphorescent fungi from the grove below. They need its light for close work, such as reading, and the fungus is edible. Crude equipment for cooking, skinning game, tanning hides, and other basic gear fills the area. Food is usually collected from the Underdark through area 43.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Among the tribal equipment, near the shaman’s bedding, is a healer’s kit and a poisoner’s kit.<br><br>The pile along the southern wall contains the tribe’s loot, mixed in with lots of other stuff taken from the goblins’ victims. The characters can find almost any piece of mundane gear that has a value of 5 gp or lower. Two items of considerable value can be unearthed by separate successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) checks: a fine agate statue of the elven deity Corellon Larethian (worth 30 gp) and a Medium chain shirt.<br><br><hr><br><h3>41. Hall of the Goblin Chief</h3><br>If the goblinoid guards in the chief’s hall have been alerted, or if they hear conflict in area 40, they cover the door for 10 minutes, then investigate the source of the disruptions at their leader’s behest.<br><br><blockquote>A circular shaft pierces the floor of this forty-foot-diameter domed chamber. Dim violet light shines out of the shaft, revealing sickly white and gray vines that coat the walls of the shaft. The light is supplemented by four lit wall torches set equidistant around the periphery of the chamber. A crudely fashioned stone throne sits against the curve of the northwestern wall. A large iron chest serves as the throne’s footstool. A sapling grows in a wide stone pot next to the throne.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> The chief of the Durbuluk tribe is <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctAuh0lK2WQCi3WVoo\">Durnn</a></strong>, a hobgoblin. When not in combat, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctAuh0lK2WQCi3WVoo\">Durnn</a> sits on the throne, and three other <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxYQCT3kaFiWGb5EP\"><strong>hobgoblins</strong></a> stand nearby or lounge on stone benches. The shaman <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctGUU7CdW46_n4ooWV\">Grenl</a></strong> advises the chief.<br><br>A <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyUtHmnc_40GiyZ1p\">twig blight</a></strong>, a gift from <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kct4hy_5RAdtPNdbxDd\">Belak the Outcast</a> and a pet of Durnn’s, is in the stone pot, and goblins from area 40 occasionally enter the chamber to see to the needs of the tribe’s elite that languish here.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctAuh0lK2WQCi3WVoo\">Durnn</a> has a <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcxrpz8v1Mx_omuWugh\"><em>potion of healing</em></a> and two vials of antitoxin. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctGUU7CdW46_n4ooWV\">Grenl</a> has a <em>spell scroll </em>of <em>faerie fire</em> and another of <em>expeditious retreat</em>.<br><br>The goblins in area 40 don’t join the battle if they hear sounds of violence coming from the north. If the fight turns against the chief, however, he might open the door to area 40 and call for aid, or withdraw to area 40 to continue the fight.<br><br><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctAuh0lK2WQCi3WVoo\">Durnn</a> can’t surrender for fear of losing face. He won’t give up if the opposition includes kobolds. Otherwise, he might call for parley if doing so allows him to avoid death. But he must still look strong while negotiating, so he’s unwilling to capitulate in an arrangement that makes him look weak.<br><br>Because <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctAuh0lK2WQCi3WVoo\">Durnn</a> and his hobgoblins usurped control of the Durbuluk tribe, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctGUU7CdW46_n4ooWV\">Grenl</a> hates them. She also wants to protect her tribe, so she is willing to negotiate a truce if <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctAuh0lK2WQCi3WVoo\">Durnn</a> falls. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctGUU7CdW46_n4ooWV\">Grenl</a> also hates and envies Belak, and she wants him gone from the citadel so she can control the Gulthias Tree.<br><br>If captured and interrogated, the goblinoids here know what Erky in area 34 knows, with the following addition: Belak wanted all the living human prisoners sent down to him, but in a fit of anger, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctAuh0lK2WQCi3WVoo\">Durnn</a> slew Talgen. Thus, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctAuh0lK2WQCi3WVoo\">Durnn</a> sent only Sharwyn and <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxSoDY1CKyuwZyBWIq\">Sir Braford</a> down to the Twilight <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kdim6hRqLOoA00A4sfR\">Grove</a>.<br><br><strong><em>Shaft.</em></strong> The shaft has a 2-foot wall around it, much like the upper end of a well. Because of the wall, a creature pushed toward the shaft can avoid going over the edge by falling prone and succeeding on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Thick, pale vines line the shaft. The vines are as good as knotted rope for the purpose of climbing.<br><br>A creature that falls into the shaft can make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to catch the vines. On a failed save, the creature falls 80 feet to the floor of area 42.<br><br><strong><em>Trapped Chest.</em></strong> Durnn’s iron chest rests in front of the throne. It is locked (Dexterity DC 15 using thieves’ tools) and trapped with a poisoned needle. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check deduces the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock. A character can then remove the needle from the lock by succeeding on a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. On a failed Dexterity check, the trap is triggered.<br><br>When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within striking distance takes 1 piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> In addition to the valuables mentioned in the “Development” section, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctAuh0lK2WQCi3WVoo\">Durnn</a> wears Talgen’s gold signet ring (worth 20 gp) and splint armor, which is identifiable by the Hucrele family crest worked into the chest pieces. The chief also has the key to his iron chest. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KctGUU7CdW46_n4ooWV\">Grenl</a> has keys to areas 34 and 37. One of the other hobgoblins wears silver earrings set with moonstones (20 gp each), and another wears a matching necklace (50 gp).<br><br>Inside Durnn’s iron chest are 231 gp and two onyx gems (30 gp each).<br><br>"

The following locations are identified on the Grove map.<br><br><h3>42. Central Garden</h3><blockquote>Luminescent fungus, shedding violet light, clings to the walls and ceiling of this wide cavern. The air is damp, chilly, and redolent with the odors of loam and decay. A layer of earth, mixed with rotting vegetation and the remains of cave animals, covers the floor. Several varieties of mushrooms and fungi grow on the detritus, as well as a few saplings.</blockquote><br>Creatures. Two <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kd9E5l6kGQ7hXjGHqdJ\"><strong>robed skeletons</strong></a> serve Belak by tending a fungus garden, using shovels and a rusted wheelbarrow to turn the soil and spread compost. In addition, two mature <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyUtHmnc_40GiyZ1p\"><strong>twig blights</strong></a> are rooted in the garden. The twig blights ambush intruders that aren’t goblinoids, and the skeletons attack (with shovels, 1d6 bludgeoning damage) anything that the twig blights target.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> The creatures in area 43 investigate any disturbance in the garden after 3 rounds.<br><br><hr><br><h3>43. The Great Hunter’s Abode</h3><blockquote>The floor of this rough cavern is stained and smells of blood and animal musk. Light from glowing fungus reveals the eastern niche, which holds a pallet of matted furs, a wide wooden board on which a variety of weapons are affixed, and a great cloak of patchy black fur hung on a slender pole. To the edge of the niche are two large nests made of hair, dry fungus, and refuse.</blockquote><br>After reading the text above reveal <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kd9HgqOMW5dedkecAWb\">Handout: Area 43</a> to your players.<br><br><strong style=\"font-style: italic\">Creature.</strong> Balsag the <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcswm9huNKTUseLKcJc\">bugbear</a></strong> and his two <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsqdF1Z2UAxuPyoB34\">giant rat</a></strong> “hounds,” named Grip and Fang, reside in a natural stone chamber when they’re not hunting (25 percent chance of being absent when characters arrive). The bugbear wears a crown of antlers on his head to enhance his frightening appearance. Balsag considers all non-Durbuluk creatures to be potential prey, so he attacks any he meets, roaring in <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxUiKkjybG9adF0V6\">Goblin</a>, “Get ready to meet the cook pot!”<br><br><strong><em>Underdark Access.</em></strong> In the dark of the northern cavern section, a crude tunnel leads away, angling west and downward. The tunnel is like the one in area 23.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Two spears, six javelins, one longsword, one greatsword are affixed to the weapon rack. A box hidden under one of the furs in Balsag’s bedding, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice, contains 241 sp and 54 gp.<br><br><hr><br><h3>44. Rift</h3><blockquote>A rift opens here, its debris-strewn floor two feet below that of the corridor. No phosphorescent fungus grows in the rift. The corridor continues past the rift, though the opening of the rift has caused it to shift 10 feet to the west. A number of two-foot-diameter holes riddle the floor of the rift. The smell of burnt earth hangs in the air.</blockquote><br>The small holes in the floor extend as far down as anyone is capable of probing.<br><br><hr><br><h3>45. Rift Node</h3><blockquote>The rift widens, creating a cavern-like chamber. Small, two-foot-diameter holes riddle the node. A dim fiery glow shines out of one such hole.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> In the glowing hall rests a <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxFxvTXlzbk21bhLC\">fire snake</a></strong>. Belak used magic to call the creature forth and hopes to train it to be a loyal servant before it matures.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Belak has already appealed to the snake’s greed with a small gift. In its nest, the adventurers find two sapphires (worth 50 gp each).<br><hr><br><h3>46. Old Shrine</h3>The stone door at the end of the corridor is closed and stuck, requiring someone to make a successful DC 15 Strength check to pull it open.<br><br><blockquote>Faded mosaic tiles still decorate parts of the wall, but most have fallen to the dust-covered floor and shattered. Situated at the center of the chamber stands a slim pedestal of rusted iron shaped like an upright dragon. In the dragon’s mouth rests an empty tray.</blockquote><br>The room once held items of importance to the old dragon cult. The remaining features are dust-covered and worthless.<br><hr><br><h3>47. Belak’s Laboratory</h3><blockquote>Two rows of dragon-carved marble columns march the length of the hall, most completely covered in luminescent fungus. The cobbled floor is cracked and stained, and on it sit many small wooden tables. The contents on the tables include mortars and pestles, small tools, bowls filled with crushed leaves, chopped fungus stalks, and other plant specimens. The many doors leading off this hall are all partly open.</blockquote><br>Belak prepares various experimental concoctions in his laboratory and the small chambers that lead off it (see the sections below), with the fumbling aid of goblins that serve him. Any noise or disturbance in the main area draws all the monsters, although those in the northwest chamber respond most slowly.<br><br><strong><em>Investigating.</em></strong> The containers on the small tables in the main area hold mashed leaves, fungus, bark, and powdered roots. A character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) check identifies many common varieties of tree, shrub, and fungus, although all have a pronounced pallor, as if sun-starved.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> One pile of herbs and supplies in the main chamber contains the ingredients of a healer’s kit. An assortment of tools and herbs can be salvaged to make up a herbalism kit and a set of alchemist’s supplies.<br><br><strong><em>Northwest Chamber.</em></strong> Snores are audible from the room to the northwest, which is a rough barracks. Sixteen small pallets of matted fur cover the floor. Two pallets currently hold a sleeping <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxUiKkjybG9adF0V6\">goblin</a></strong> and two <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kd9-Cxq3v9K76O0k5Uq\"><strong>goblin commoners</strong></a>.<br><br><strong><em>Southwest Chamber. </em></strong>The goblins use a crude mashing, straining, and casking facility to create goblin wine, which they and Belak are quite fond of. Two <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kd9-Cxq3v9K76O0k5Uq\"><strong>goblin commoners</strong></a> currently stand barefoot in the mashing-tun, squashing roots and fungi into pulp. A dirty straining bin stands nearby, as well as ten 2-gallon casks of the end product.<br><br><strong><em>North Central Chamber.</em></strong> Two <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kd9-Cxq3v9K76O0k5Uq\"><strong>goblin commoners</strong></a> currently repair dirty goblin armor with cord, iron needles, leather patches, and other crude implements of tailoring.<br><br><strong><em>South Central Chamber.</em></strong> One <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxUiKkjybG9adF0V6\">goblin</a></strong> and two <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kd9-Cxq3v9K76O0k5Uq\"><strong>goblin commoners</strong></a> monitor the health of a diseased giant rat, which is strapped spread-eagled onto a wooden bench. The rat suffers from horrible tumors that look woody and fruit-like. Its tumors stem from an elixir Belak created to infuse twig blight traits into giant rats.<br><br>On a stand in the corner is a fancy crystal vial (worth 5 gp) that contains the elixir. Drinking the elixir exposes the drinker to the same disease that the diseased rat might impart with its bite, except the initial saving throw DC is 15.<br><br><strong><em>Northeast Chamber. </em></strong>Extra weapon stores include five battered scimitars, six shortbows, and forty arrows.<br><br><strong><em>Southeast Chamber. </em></strong>The room stands empty, and the caved-in back wall leads to a natural rift in the earth (see area 44).<br><br><hr><br><h3>48. Garden Galleries</h3>The two galleries that lead to the arboretums have the same characteristics. The doors to all connecting areas are closed.<br><br><blockquote>Nodules of luminescent fungus hang from the ceiling and walls and grow in clumps on the flagstone floor. The light illuminates portions of grand bas-relief carvings on the stone walls that aren’t covered with the fungus. The carvings depict dragons in various stages of raining fire down upon terrified people. Soil and compost cover half the chamber’s floor, which allows a variety of feeble plants to grow. A bench containing simple gardening implements stands along the west wall.</blockquote><br>Belak is using the galleries to grow aboveground vegetation using the light of luminescent fungus.<br><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> A <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kd9LBgLukhAGbmMStPO\">bugbear gardener</a></strong> roams both galleries, tending the grasses for Belak. She is armed with a sickle-bladed glaive.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The bugbear carries a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcxrpz8v1Mx_omuWugh\">potion of healing</a></em>.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> The neighboring arboretums (area 49) contain additional monsters. The closed doors and stone walls prevent sound from entering these four areas. The creatures within join the battle here at your discretion.<br><br><hr><br><h3>49. Arboretums</h3><blockquote>Luminescent mist blurs the edges of this octagonal chamber. Nodules of glowing fungus dot the stone walls and ceiling, as well as the caps of toadstools and mushrooms, small polyps, puffballs, and lichen. The humid air reeks with rot.</blockquote><br>The arboretums hold small samples of traditional Underdark ecosystems, which aren’t difficult for Belak to nurture. The stone doors leading to them are unlocked.<br><br><strong><em>Southern Arboretum.</em></strong> A <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxUiKkjybG9adF0V6\">goblin</a></strong> and three <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kd9-Cxq3v9K76O0k5Uq\"><strong>goblin commoners</strong></a> gather fungus for use in area 47.<br><br><strong><em>Southeast Arboretum.</em></strong> Several growths in the chamber are scorched and dead. Fungus shrouds holes similar to those found in area 45, and a <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxFxvTXlzbk21bhLC\">fire snake</a></strong> lurks inside one of these openings. It emerges if anyone pokes into or closely examines the holes. If the snake comes out, a character who reaches into the snake’s burrow can recover two sapphires (worth 50 gp each).<br><br><strong><em>Northeast Arboretum.</em></strong> Three <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kd9E5l6kGQ7hXjGHqdJ\"><strong>skeletons</strong></a>—AC 12, 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage with shovels or rakes—are at work, clearing scorched plants. One <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyUtHmnc_40GiyZ1p\">twig blight</a></strong>, which is hostile to the adventurers, is with them. The skeletons attack anything the twig blight attacks.<br><br>Fungus shrouds holes similar to those in area 45.<br><br><strong><em>Northern Arboretum.</em></strong> The northern room contains only its plants.<br><br><hr><br><h3>50. Ashardalon’s Shrine</h3><blockquote>Dragon-carved granite blocks line this chamber’s walls and ceiling, though many are crumbled and broken, leaving stony debris on the floor. A huge marble statue of a rearing red dragon stands in the curve of the western wall. The eye sockets of the dragon are empty, but a red glow lingers there, providing reddish light throughout the chamber. The radiance casts an inky shadow behind the statue’s wide wings. A five-foot-diameter, circular tile of dark stone is set in the floor in front of the dragon statue. Runes are carved around the circular tile’s inner edge.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Investigating.</em></strong> Viewed in white light, the circular tile is red. A <em>detect magic</em> spell can reveal that the tile and statue give off an aura of transmutation. The runes on the tile’s inner edge read, in Draconic, “Let the sorcerous power illuminate my spirit.” If anyone speaks this sentence aloud while standing on the tile, a puff of spectral flame harmlessly envelops the speaker, granting the target advantage on Charisma checks for 24 hours. Once the tile is activated, it is dormant for 24 hours.<br><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> A <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcsy5oNkRSN8iL0Y3ca\">shadow</a></strong> hides in the gloom behind the dragon statue. It attacks only those who spot it or who attempt to investigate the circular tile or claim the treasure. The creature doesn’t pursue those who flee.<br><br><strong>Treasure.</strong> A loose stone is in the wall behind the statue, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. Inside are 34 gp and two flasks of alchemist’s fire.<br><br><hr><br><h3>51. Dragon Library</h3><blockquote>Leaning and fallen stone bookshelves fill this chamber, though a clear path connects wooden doors on opposite walls. Torn and burnt pages, bindings, and scrolls form disordered piles in the corners.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Rooting around in the wreckage, separate successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) checks uncover a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcyj_fsxEF8rpYcpooV\">spell scroll</a> </em>of<em> scorching ray</em>, a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcyj_fsxEF8rpYcpooV\">spell scroll</a></em> of <em>Melf’s acid arrow</em>, and a tome of dragon lore bound in dragon scale and written in Draconic (worth 150 gp).<br><br><hr><br><h3>52. Underpass</h3><blockquote>Damp and crumbled steps descend sharply.</blockquote><br>The steps descend 15 feet. An 8-foot-high stone corridor passes about 7 feet below the northern arboretum (area 49), connecting the stairways on either side.<br><br><hr><br><h3>53. Belak’s Study</h3>The wooden door leading to Belak’s study is closed and locked. The lock can be undone by someone who uses thieves’ tools and succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check.<br><br><blockquote>A layer of soil covers the floor. Rough wooden shelves, filled with a scattering of tomes and scrolls, line the north and east walls, and a rough-hewn desk stands in the center of the chamber. Fungus on the ceiling provides light, apparently in sufficient quantity to nourish several small bushes and pale saplings that grow in the soil.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Investigating.</em></strong> In his study, Belak stores seasonal records of growth, precipitation, harvests, and similar notes for the surrounding lands for the last dozen years. One interesting tome titled (in Draconic) <em>Treasures of the Fire Lords</em> has a <em>glyph of warding</em> spell with an explosive runes effect on it. The glyph is on the second page, and it’s triggered when someone opens to that page. Otherwise, the book is blank.<br><br>If the glyph is triggered, it erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the book. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 22 (5d8) cold damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cold doesn’t damage the other works here.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If any obvious disturbance occurs here, the goblins in area 54 set an ambush for intruders. They wait at least 10 minutes before coming to investigate.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Separate successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) checks uncover a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcyj_fsxEF8rpYcpooV\">spell scroll</a></em> of <em>entangle</em>, a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcyj_fsxEF8rpYcpooV\">spell scroll</a></em> of <em>protection from poison</em>, and a tome on druidic theories on the cycle of life and death (worth 150 gp). Cubbyholes in the desk hold 365 gp and four agate gems (20 gp each).<br><br><hr><br><h3>54. Grove Gate</h3><blockquote>Twigs and roots are piled on the floor of this sagging chamber. The collapsed southern wall opens into a vast cavern. Luminescent fungus on the rough walls and the high roof loom over a twilight grove of sickly briars, bushes, saplings, and other woody plants. Ruined walls and hollow towers protrude from the briars.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Four <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxUiKkjybG9adF0V6\"><strong>goblins</strong></a> sort the specimens for Belak. They are hostile to intruders. If things go badly for them, they cry out in <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxUiKkjybG9adF0V6\">Goblin</a>, saying, “Aid us, Protector of the Twilight Grove!”<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> Sometimes the twig blights in area 55 attack the goblins out of sheer malice. Thus, a call from the goblins doesn’t bring all the forces of the cavern down on the characters. But if the goblins do call, four <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyUtHmnc_40GiyZ1p\"><strong>twig blights</strong></a> arrive from area 55 and attack.<br><br><strong><em>Investigating.</em></strong> Any character who gazes into area 55 and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the blackened top of the Gulthias Tree in the distance. If the check succeeds by 3 or more, the character also spots the twig blights creeping around in area 55.<br><br><hr><br><h3>55. Twilight Grove</h3><blockquote>Pale, spindly briars press close, casting twisted shadows on the earth floor in the violet light.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Briars.</em></strong> The most successful aboveground plants that Belak has transplanted in the Twilight Grove are the briars, though they appear sickly and pale, with blighted leaves. Other common plants and bushes are also represented, though they are equally afflicted.<br><br>The briars don’t hinder Small and smaller creatures. Larger creatures must either spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot moved or make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw for every 10 feet moved. On a failed save, the creature takes 1 piercing damage from the briars.<br><br> A 5-foot-by-5-foot area of briars can be cleared if it takes 20 damage of any type other than psychic.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Ten <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyUtHmnc_40GiyZ1p\"><strong>twig blights</strong></a>, less any that were dispatched in area 54, are spread about the grove. After moving 50 feet into the cavern, the characters come upon 1d4 of the hostile creatures. Any significant noise, such as from combat or clearing the briars, also attracts 1d4 − 1 twig blights (minimum 0) each round.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If the characters get to area 56 before all the twig blights have engaged, the rest of the monsters hold off their attacks. Any conflict that involves yelling in a language other than <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxUiKkjybG9adF0V6\">Goblin</a>, the use of flashy magical effects, or similar noticeable elements alerts Belak in area 56 to the approach of invaders.<br><br><hr><br><h3>56. The Gulthias Tree</h3><blockquote>A walled clearing is here among the briars. The walls are about twenty feet high, which is less than half the height of the cavern’s ceiling. Several varieties of plants grow around the perimeter of the clearing, including a few suspicious-looking saplings, but their importance pales before that which stands at the courtyard’s center. Beneath the fungal light grows an evil tree. Its blackened, twisted limbs reach upward, like a skeletal hand clawing its way out of the earth. Before it stand a few twig blights; a heavily armored, young human male with a shield and sword; a blonde, young human woman in a robe fit for a noble; and a middle-aged, bearded human male wearing a hooded brown robe and armed with a staff and sickle. The younger humans have black eyes and gray skin with the texture of bark.</blockquote><br>After reading the text above reveal <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kd8JqkrUHrUX3RVL90a\">Handout: Area 56</a> to your players.<br><br><strong style=\"font-style: italic\">Creatures.</strong> <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kct4hy_5RAdtPNdbxDd\">Belak the Outcast</a></strong> spends much of his time studying <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kd9W1s03E_aop4MwFWI\">the Gulthias Tree</a>, but he is well aware when the characters are approaching. <br><br>Standing with Belak are <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxSoDY1CKyuwZyBWIq\">Sir Braford</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kcthr3FJCDs-rfnYJFv\">Sharwyn Hucrele</a></strong>. Belak’s <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsxKWt83jlxKDOQPTF\">giant frog</a></strong>, Kulket, lurks stealthily in the branches of the Gulthias Tree. A character who has a passive Perception score of 15 or higher or succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the frog. If combat breaks out, the frog jumps down and joins the fight in the second round. Three <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcsyUtHmnc_40GiyZ1p\"><strong>twig blights</strong></a> are here, too.<br><br><strong><em>Interaction.</em></strong> When the characters arrive, Belak says loudly, “Hold a moment, you know not what you do!” If the characters engage him in conversation, he can share the following information:<br><br><em>What are you doing?</em> “I am Belak, called the Outcast. My circle expelled me, the fools. Why? Because I dared to expand nature’s reach in ways they ­couldn’t grasp. I have found what I sought in the Gulthias Tree.”<br><br><em>What is the Gulthias Tree?</em> “It’s beautiful, no? It lives, though it looks dead. In an age long past, someone staked a vampire on this very spot. The stake took root. And so grew the Gulthias Tree, reverberating with primal power for those who can tap it.”<br><br><em>What’s with the stick-monsters?</em> “The twig blights grow from seeds of the tree’s fruit.”<br><br><em>What’s going on with the fruit?</em> “I give fruit to the goblins with orders to disperse their seeds on the surface. Deceitful beings that they are, the goblins barter the fruit, but the seeds are dispersed all the same. My plan for colonizing the surface with the children of Gulthias continues.”<br><br><em>What did you do to the other adventurers?</em> “They were the first supplicants. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kd9W1s03E_aop4MwFWI\">The Gulthias Tree</a> has accepted them, and they are mine to control, just like the twig blights. You can’t save them.”<br><br><em>Why are you talking to us?</em> “Though your remains would enrich the com­post, you’ll serve my needs better as supplicants. You shall retain your lives, after a fashion. Surrender and submit peacefully, or perish!”<br><br>While this interaction proceeds, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxSoDY1CKyuwZyBWIq\">Sir Braford</a>, the three twig blights, and Belak’s frog position themselves between the characters and Belak (Sharwyn stands next to Belak).<br><br><strong><em>Combat.</em></strong> If a fight breaks out (which will happen unless the characters actually submit to Belak), the twig blights, the frog, and <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxSoDY1CKyuwZyBWIq\">Sir Braford</a> attack the characters physically. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxSoDY1CKyuwZyBWIq\">Sir Braford</a> uses <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcxp5AvsrEo4YlkIjPB\">Shatterspike</a></em> to destroy his foe’s weapon, if possible.<br><br>Belak casts <em>barkskin</em> on himself, possibly before melee occurs. He also makes early use of his <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KcxpG8GGbBaE0RTO-wn\">wand of entangle</a></em>, attempting to hold the transgressors in place. If Braford looks like he needs healing, Belak casts healing spells on him, as well. Sharwyn uses her repertoire of spells to best advantage, resorting to her dagger only in desperation.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> During a battle, if any twig blights remain in area 55, 1d4 − 1 of them (minimum 0) enter this area each round.<br><br><strong><em>Targeting the Tree.</em></strong> A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check or Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) check allows a character to deduce that destroying the tree might have an effect on <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxSoDY1CKyuwZyBWIq\">Sir Braford</a>, Sharwyn, and the twig blights. If anyone attacks the Gulthias Tree, Belak and the twig blights try to kill the aggressor. If <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kd9W1s03E_aop4MwFWI\">the Gulthias Tree</a> dies, Belak loses his influence over the twig blights, Sharwyn, and <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KcxSoDY1CKyuwZyBWIq\">Sir Braford</a>. These monsters turn on Belak before targeting the characters again.<br><br><strong><em>Walls.</em></strong> The courtyard’s walls stand 20 feet tall, and the cavern’s stalactite-dotted ceiling is 50 feet up.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Belak has a key (to area 53), three <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kcxrpz8v1Mx_omuWugh\"><em>potions of healing</em></a>, two doses of antitoxin, and his <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KcxpG8GGbBaE0RTO-wn\">wand of entangle</a></em>. Sharwyn wears her gold Hucrele signet ring (worth 20 gp).<br>"

He shows the characters a broken blade bearing the smith&#x2019;s mark, and tells them that it was discovered near a rocky hill called the Stone Tooth. Baron Althon provides directions and promises to reward the characters richly for each of Durgeddin&#x2019;s blades they recover.

Centuries ago, his home was sacked by orcs. Durgeddin led the remnants of his clan to the mountains north of the town of Blasingdell and established a small, secret stronghold somewhere in the trackless wilderness.<br><br>From his hidden redoubt, he waged a decades-long vendetta against all orc-kind, until his enemies discovered his fortress and attacked it after a long siege. Durgeddin and his followers perished, and much wealth was carried away by the conquering hordes. But it&#x2019;s said that the deepest and best-hidden vaults and armories escaped the looting, and that some of Durgeddin&#x2019;s extraordinary blades still wait in the darkness for a hand bold enough to claim one.<br><br>You&#x2019;ve come to Blasingdell, a small mining town on the northern frontier, to see if there&#x2019;s anything to these stories. Your map shows that the old dwarf-hold lies about three days&#x2019; march to the north of the town. Dark, deeply forested hills rise beyond the town&#x2019;s outskirts.</blockquote><br>The characters can spend time interacting with the townsfolk, gathering equipment and provisions, and otherwise preparing before they set out.<br><br><h3>The Stone Tooth</h3><hr>When the characters set forth on their journey, read:<br><br><blockquote>As you travel north from the mining town of Blasingdell, you pass through brooding pine forests and deep vales. From where you stand now, you catch sight of a tall, steep hill that rises to a prominent bare knob of rock&#x2014;the Stone Tooth. A thin spire of smoke rises from some unseen point high on the hill&#x2019;s slopes, and you can make out a steep, narrow road or track that runs back and forth across the face of the mountainside.</blockquote><br>Refer to the map in this handout. The characters have several options: follow the path, scout the area, or wait and watch.<br><br><h4>Follow the Path</h4>At the foot of the Stone Tooth, a carefully constructed path winds up the hillside to some unseen height above. Durgeddin&#x2019;s clan concealed its presence as much as possible, but years of wind and rain have eroded away its cover, leaving the path exposed and visible from the valley floor below.<br><br>The path climbs to the Mountain Door, at the location marked A on the map. This is the route used by the orcs in Great Ulfe&#x2019;s tribe to come and go from their lair.<br><br>If someone checks the path for tracks, a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals that four booted humanoids came down it within the last day and headed into the forest. The trail joins older tracks in the woods and becomes indistinguishable after about half a mile. These tracks belong to orc foraging parties; see &#x201C;Wait and Watch,&#x201D; for more information.<br><br><h4>Scout the Area</h4>Ambitious characters might choose to ignore the path and scale the Stone Tooth&#x2019;s slopes. The going is very hard, with steep slopes and heavy undergrowth, reducing the characters&#x2019; travel pace to roughly 100 feet per minute. Thoroughly exploring the hillside could easily take hours.<br><br>Heavy woods block the view upslope, making it difficult to ascertain the origin of the smoke (a natural chimney). Have the party&#x2019;s guide make a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check when the group first enters the hillside. On a successful check, the characters travel in the general direction of the chimney. Otherwise, they lose their way (see <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KeFXNDWRT7mBWdgRTMS\">Becoming Lost</a>).<br><br><strong><em>(A) The Mountain Door.</em></strong> This is the front entrance to the Glitterhame. The old dwarf-path leads up to a bare shoulder of rock and then turns into a deep cleft in the hillside. If the characters enter this way, the expedition begins in area 1 of the Mountain Door.<br><br><strong><em>(B) Chimney.</em></strong> When the characters reach the area marked B on the map, they can discover the source of the smoke. A natural rock chimney leads down into the caverns below, and a thin stream of smoke rises through it. The smoke spreads out and isn&#x2019;t easy to pinpoint in the rugged terrain.<br><br>A character who searches for the source of the smoke finds the rock chimney with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the characters pass nearby without searching, anyone who has a passive Perception score of 15 or higher notices the fissure.<br><br>If the characters descend the chimney, the expedition begins in area 7 of the Mountain Door.<br><br><strong><em>(C) Orc Tunnel.</em></strong> On the other side of the Stone Tooth, a few hundred yards from the Mountain Door, the orc army burrowed into the hillside to circumvent the dwarven defenses. The tunnel is still passable, but its entrance is choked with brush and debris. If the characters enter this area, someone who has a passive Perception score of 15 or higher discovers the orc tunnel. The characters locate the tunnel automatically if anyone searches the area; it leads to area 21 of the Glitterhame.<br><br>The tunnel entrance is about 6 feet high and 4 feet wide. Anyone who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check can spot old tracks passing in and out of the tunnel&#x2014;reptilian footprints (from the troglodytes inhabiting the Glitterhame) and the paw prints of a very large bear.<br><br><strong><em>(D) Hilltop.</em></strong> An hour or two of hard hiking brings the party to the summit. The Stone Tooth is about 1,450 feet in height, towering over the neighboring hills by 500 feet or more. The last 100 feet or so are a sheer point of rock, requiring DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks to climb successfully. The view is spectacular, but the hilltop is otherwise unremarkable. (No entrance to the fortress is to be found here.)<br><br><strong><em>(E) The Dark Mere.</em></strong> The eastern slopes of the Stone Tooth descend into a damp valley where water is trapped by the terrain. A dark tarn pools under the hill&#x2019;s slopes, surrounded by numerous smaller lakes. A hidden drainage channel deep underwater connects to the subterranean Black Lake, providing access to Nightscale&#x2019;s underground lair.<br><br>The opening is about 40 feet down, and it lies about 100 feet from the western lakeshore. Player characters exploring around the lake can&#x2019;t find this outlet unless they conduct extensive dives to plumb the mere&#x2019;s depths, requiring DC 10 Strength (Athletics) checks to swim underwater. If any characters are capable of staying this deep without suffocating and conduct a thorough search of the lake, they discover the passage with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the characters enter through this watery passage, they emerge in area 54 of the Black Lake.<br><br><h4>Wait and Watch</h4>The characters might choose to observe the path for some time before braving the Stone Tooth. When they arrive, two foraging parties from Great Ulfe&#x2019;s tribe are searching the nearby hills for loot. The first party of four <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSfoDGOT0AnPY4AiF\">orcs</a></strong> returns two days after the characters arrive, and the second group three days after that. These orcs sleep by day and travel by night, so they arrive in the party&#x2019;s vicinity just before dawn.<br><br>If the party sets up camp at least 90 feet from the path and doesn&#x2019;t take any action that might draw attention, the returning orcs pass by without spotting the campsite. Otherwise, the orcs notice the camp when they come within 90 feet (or within twice as far if a campfire is burning or the party isn&#x2019;t attempting to be quiet).<br><br>A lookout whose post overlooks the trail and who has a passive Perception score of 10 or higher detects the orcs as they approach. The orcs aren&#x2019;t likely to notice a hidden lookout; compare their passive Perception scores to the character&#x2019;s Dexterity (Stealth) check.<br><br><blockquote>Four hunched humanoids in dirty hide armor approach along the trail, snarling and muttering to each other in a guttural tongue. Yellow tusks jut from their bestial faces.</blockquote><br>If the orcs come across the camp and aren&#x2019;t spotted, they attempt to take out anyone on watch or creep into the camp to attack sleeping characters.<br><br>If an orc party moves past the characters unchallenged or fights its way through, the survivors reinforce the defenses in the complex (see area 5 and area 14 in <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdlrqXTLxkJdo9GhKQy\">The Mountain Door</a>).<br><br>Captured orcs can describe in some detail the general arrangement of the Mountain Door. They don&#x2019;t know anything about the rest of the complex, or that it&#x2019;s possible to enter through the chimney. The orcs defending the Mountain Door refuse to negotiate for their return.<br><br>The characters might disguise themselves as orcs using captured gear. Doing so can let them try to bluff their way past sentries in the dungeon, using Charisma (Deception) checks contested by the orcs&#x2019; Wisdom (Insight) checks.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Each orc carries a sack of mundane supplies looted from the countryside, as well as coinage totaling 4d6 sp and 1d4 gp.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> No more dungeon denizens emerge from the dungeon during this time, and no more orcs leave for a week after the second patrol returns.<br>"

The place is still well fortified, even to this day.<br><br>This former dwarven strongpoint is now occupied by a band of orc raiders, led by a fierce ogre who calls himself <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSc-zrVIkGl4zZhpe\">Great Ulfe</a>. These raiders emerge from the Mountain Door to hunt and pillage in the surrounding area. To keep their lair secure, the orcs have blocked access to the lower levels of Khundrukar, and they rarely encounter the other denizens of the cave system.<br><br>The following locations are identified on the map in this handout.<br><hr><br><h3>1. End of the Trail</h3>The old dwarven path ascends to a cleft in the hillside and ends at the front door of Khundrukar.<br><br><blockquote>The path climbs up one last steep switchback toward a bare shoulder of rock. The hillside rises steeply on your right and drops away precipitously on your left. Debris and rubbish lie scattered over the last hundred yards or so—discarded water skins, bits of charred bone, and splintered casks or kegs. Up ahead, the path opens onto a wide ledge and then doubles back sharply into the mountainside.<br><br>Two bestial humanoids in hide armor stand watch on the ledge. They appear inattentive and bored.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Two <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSfoDGOT0AnPY4AiF\">orcs</a></strong> stand guard along the northern edge of the ledge, though they aren’t paying as much attention to their duties as they should. The characters (or their advance scout) can spot them from as far as 60 feet away. The sentries, Wark and Thark, are grumbling in the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSfoDGOT0AnPY4AiF\">Orc</a> language about someone named Ulfe. Apply a −2 penalty to the orcs’ passive Perception scores.<br><br><strong><em>Arrow Slits.</em></strong> When the characters move around the corner into the eastern part of the ledge, they might discover a row of hidden arrow slits in the rocky wall to the east about 15 feet above the floor. By examining the wall and making a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notices the slits.<br><br><strong><em>Developments.</em></strong> If they are attacked or confronted by more than one character, Wark and Thark call out a warning that’s heard by the orc in area 4 and then attempt to flee to area 3. See <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdltZ8eZ5_sGYcr6Co-\">Mountain Door Defenses</a>.<br><br>If the archers are alerted to the party’s presence, they open fire on intruders on the ledge and in area 2. See area 4 for more information.<br><hr><br><h3>2. The Dwarf-Door</h3>Moving eastward from the ledge, the trail turns south and rises steeply through a cleft in the rock toward a grand entrance.<br><br><blockquote>Shallow steps lead up through a steep fissure to the south and turn east into the mountainside. Here, a broad entranceway has been carved out of the stone. Marble steps cracked with age and veined with green moss lead up to a strong double door of carved stone, eight feet wide and almost ten feet tall. Arrow slits high on the north and south walls command this area.</blockquote><br>If the characters quietly dealt with the orcs in area 1 using stealth or disguise, the door is open. Otherwise, the orcs have been alerted to intruders, and the door is shut and barred from the inside. Forcing open the barred door is very difficult, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> If the orcs have been alerted, the orcs in areas 4 and 4a fire arrows until the characters either retreat or succeed in bypassing the door.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If the characters are repelled, they must deal with additional reinforcements if they try this approach again. Two orcs from area 11 stand watch at the doors on the west side of area 3, while the orc Eye of Gruumsh from area 9 backs up the orcs in area 4 or 4a.<br><hr><br><h3>3. The Rift Hall</h3><br><blockquote>The great door opens into a large hall. A narrow ledge overlooks a deep, dark crevasse that cuts the room in two. A dangerous-looking rope bridge, frayed and thin, spans the gap. Water gurgles and rushes somewhere far below. Two copper braziers burn brightly on either side of the door, illuminating the western half of the room. Another ledge is barely visible on the other side of the chasm.</blockquote><br>The hall beyond the doors, and the great crevasse that runs through it, once served as the last line of defense for Khundrukar’s dwarves.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Two <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSfoDGOT0AnPY4AiF\">orcs</a></strong> guard the eastern side of the room. They do everything in their power to prevent the characters from getting across the bridge. If any of the party members have darkvision or a means of illuminating the far side, read:<br><br><blockquote>Two brutish humanoids stand watch on the other side of the crevasse. They snarl a challenge, revealing yellowed tusks, and prepare to hurl javelins at you!</blockquote><br>After reading the text above reveal <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdluXWQYs9Jrx0pP27o\">Handout: Area 3</a> to your players.<br><br><strong><em>Rope Bridge.</em></strong> The bridge is safe structurally, despite its appearance. Crossing under fire is difficult enough to require DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. On a successful check, a character can move at half speed. On a failed check, a character makes no progress. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character must make a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the character plummets almost 200 feet to the underground river below and is swept away. The characters can prevent falls by roping themselves to a stable attachment point before crossing.<br><br><strong><em>Secret Doors.</em></strong> Two secret doors on the north and south walls lead to areas 4 and 4a. The doors are well made, each requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to discover. A door can be opened by simultaneously pushing in two concealed stone plates in the wall about 1 foot above it. The plates can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.<br><br><strong><em>Developments.</em></strong> The orcs use the rock outcroppings on their side for shelter from attacks, gaining half cover. They throw their javelins at characters trying to cross the bridge, or at those who hang back to cast spells or make ranged attacks. A character on the bridge who is hit by an attack must make a saving throw to avoid a fall, just as if the character’s Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to move along the bridge had failed by 5 or more.<br><br>If an intruder gets at least two-thirds of the way across the bridge, one orc breaks cover to move through the double doors into area 5 and get help. The other tries to hinder the characters by chopping at the bridge’s support ropes with its greataxe. Each rope has 8 hit points and AC 11. If one support rope is cut, the DC of the Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to cross the bridge increases to 12, and characters on the bridge must immediately make a saving throw to avoid falling as described above. If both ropes are cut, the east end of the bridge drops into the crevasse and slams into the cliff wall on the west side. Any characters on the bridge take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the impact with the wall and must make successful DC 12 Strength or Dexterity saving throws to avoid losing their grip and falling if they aren’t otherwise secured.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If the orcs destroy the bridge but repel the invaders in doing so, Great Ulfe’s followers rebuild it within three days. Any orcs killed here are replaced by orcs from area 11.<br><br><hr><br><h3>4 and 4a. Archers’ Stations</h3>The dwarves carved out chambers on either side of the entryway so they could rain arrows down on attackers that approached the front door of their stronghold. The arrow slits are 15 feet or more above the floor of areas 1 and 2 and are impassible for creatures larger than Tiny. They grant three-quarters cover to the orcs stationed behind them.<br><br>The secret doors in area 3 provide access to these locations.<br><br> <blockquote>The door slides aside to reveal a narrow passage that descends a flight of stairs into a small chamber. Light from outside slants into the room through a series of narrow embrasures.<br><br>The area is littered with well-gnawed bones, cobwebs, and rat droppings. Poorly cured hide blankets are carelessly scattered over the floor.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Secret Door.</em></strong> In the north end of area 4, a secret door connects to area 14. A character can find the door by succeeding on a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check. The orcs are unaware of this passage and don’t use it.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Four <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdlvNsRbg43GZjFF4B0\">orcs with longbows</a></strong>, three in area 4 and one in area 4a, overlook the stairs leading up to area 2. These orcs aren’t particularly vigilant, but they do start shooting if the sentries in area 1 call for help. The orcs are armed with longbows instead of javelins.<br><br>When the characters turn the corner into area 2, the archer in area 4a joins the attack while one of the archers from area 4 circles around through the secret door in an attempt to shut the double doors to area 3 (see Mountain Door Defenses).<br><br>If the heroes attack by coming through the secret doors that lead to these areas, the archers fire at characters descending the stairs, then switch to greataxes and move up to block the stairways.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If the characters dispose of the sentries in area 1 quietly, the orcs in area 4 might not notice them. Characters can attempt to sneak past the row of arrow slits by comparing their Dexterity (Stealth) checks to the orcs’ passive Perception scores. If the characters successfully sneak past the sentries, they reach area 2 without alerting the archers.<br><br>If the characters defeat these orcs but withdraw from the dungeon before overcoming the rest of them, the archers are replaced by orcs from area 14 and reinforced by the orc eye of Gruumsh from area 9.<br><br><hr><br><h3>5. Orc Cave</h3><br><blockquote>The walls and floor of this natural cave have been carefully smoothed. You can discern at least four routes leading off into darkness. Red coals glow from within the southeastern passageway, and a crude wooden cage door closes off the southern exit. The floor is covered with sleeping furs, crates, sacks, and rubbish.</blockquote><br>The second orc raiding party normally lairs in the open area east of the doors. These orcs are currently out of the dungeon unless the party spent several days observing the hillside (see “Wait and Watch,\" in <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdlQOCvLsalE_r-f5FX\">Approaching Khundrukar</a>) before entering.<br><br><strong><em>Cage Door.</em></strong> The cage door to the south leads to area 6, where two prisoners languish under the orcs’ indifferent care. The prisoners leap to their feet and rush to the cage door to cry for help when the characters enter area 5.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The crates and sacks in this room contain mundane supplies looted from the countryside—flour, grain, nails, and so on. The total value is about 20 gp for about 500 pounds of material. Additionally, if characters are held captive in area 6, their equipment is stored here.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> When the second orc raiding party returns (five days after the characters arrive at the Stone Tooth), they take up residence here. Add four orcs to this room after their return.<br><br><hr><br><h3>6. Prisoner Cave</h3>The orcs occasionally capture miners, settlers, and merchants traveling through the forests north of <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdlPOsOzTK6hQ1zC0vz\">Blasingdell</a>. They keep their captives in a small pen until they put them to death or ransom them.<br><br><blockquote>A row of rough-hewn sapling trunks forms a crude but serviceable barrier across the mouth of this small cave. A door locked with an iron padlock secures the room. Inside, you see two filthy prisoners dressed in tattered rags, crowding close to the door. “Thank Yondalla!” one cries out. “We’re rescued!”</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> The prisoners are a pair of human <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhRbC-U5kqTqICnWjy\">commoners</a></strong> named Geradil and Courana. They hail from a small settlement a few miles from <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdlPOsOzTK6hQ1zC0vz\">Blasingdell</a>, and the orcs have held them captive for almost a month now. Neither one’s family could raise the ransom demanded by their captors, so both await a terrible death at the orcs’ hands.<br><br>Opening the cage door requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, the key from Old Yarrack’s pocket (see area 14), or a sharp axe and a little time. (The padlock has AC 19 and 5 hit points.) Geradil and Courana are extremely grateful for their rescue, but they will not join the characters in their quest—neither is skilled at fighting, and they just want to go home.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The characters can free the prisoners and escort them back to their homes (about a day’s travel away). The grateful families reward them with two <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOuZOZ8F6tpvRDI-Ioo\">potions of healing</a></em>. Taking the time to see Geradil and Courana to safety, however, gives the orcs a chance to prepare for the next assault.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> Any characters captured by the orcs eventually wind up in the cage, unless they demonstrate that they’re too much trouble to be left alive. Their gear is stored among the other supplies in area 5. New characters joining the party might also be introduced as prisoners here.<br><hr><br><h3>7. Fire in the Hole</h3>The irregular chamber southeast of the main cave holds the main cooking fire of the tribe. A crevice in its ceiling winds up through the rock to the natural chimney on the hilltop above (see “The Stone Tooth” in <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdlQOCvLsalE_r-f5FX\">Approaching Khundrukar</a>).<br><br> <blockquote>A large, smoky fire crackles in the center of this room. Battered pots and kettles are stacked all over; clearly, this space serves as a crude kitchen. You feel a distinct draft drawing the smoke up through a rough hole in the ceiling.</blockquote> <br>The characters might attempt to descend into the area through the chimney. The shaft is about 80 feet long; its walls are irregular and rough but slippery, requiring successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks to climb. Anchoring a rope at the top of the shaft reduces the check DC to 5. A careful climber can easily avoid the fire on the way down.<br><br>If a character’s check fails by 5 or more, the character must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or fall the rest of the way down the chimney. In addition to falling damage, the character takes an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage from the hot coals and makes enough noise to alert any orcs in area 5.<br><br><hr><br><h3>8. Orc Commons</h3><br><blockquote>Haphazard stacks of crates, barrels, sacks, and bundles crowd this long cavern. To the north, two finished stone passageways open to the east and west; a narrower opening leads south. In the southeast corner is an old well full of murky water.</blockquote><br>The cavern is full of plunder from the orcs’ raids through the surrounding area: foodstuffs, ale, blankets, tools, timber, pitch, nails, wool, and similar goods.<br><br><strong><em>Iron Gate.</em></strong> The passage leading east is blocked about 10 feet in by tightly packed crates and sacks of flour. Removing this material allows travel for another 20 feet to the east, where the tunnel ends at an iron gate stuffed with blankets and straw pallets. The orcs created these barricades to prevent the stirges in area 10 from getting out.<br><br>The iron gate’s lock is rusted shut; it can be picked with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check by a character using thieves’ tools or forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.<br><br><strong><em> Secret Doors.</em></strong> The passage to the south branches in a Y shape. The southwest branch connects to area 5, and the southeast one leads to a secret door cleverly constructed to blend into the natural rock of the cave. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers the door.<br><br>On the other side, a worked passage continues up to what appears to be a blank wall, marked with hexes and curses in <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSfoDGOT0AnPY4AiF\">Orc</a>. The markings conceal another secret door, which requires a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to find.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The mundane supplies have a total value of about 20 gp for about 500 pounds of material.<br><br>With a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character finds a loose stone. Behind it is hidden a small locked strongbox containing 180 gp and a flask of holy water. This is the personal treasure of Old Yarrack (see area 11).<br><br><hr><br><h3>9. Shaman’s Lair</h3><br><blockquote>The secret door pivots open to reveal a chamber of finished stonework. The room is cluttered with crude furnishings, and the air is hazy with the smoke of a small cooking fire. Dozens of yellowed skulls are suspended from the ceiling by fraying ropes strung through holes punched in the bone. An orc in a ragged black robe looks up from her work, her face twisted in an expression of rage.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Burdug the shaman, an <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhShnxiKkb1sJuGGDE\">orc Eye of Gruumsh</a></strong>, has commandeered a chamber as her private domain. She lives here with her two followers, female <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSfoDGOT0AnPY4AiF\">orcs</a></strong>, separate from the rest of the tribe.<br><br>The door to area 10 is locked, but the key is inserted in the keyhole on this side. Burdug keeps the door closed because she wants to confine the stirges on the other side. (She calls the stirges her “little stingies” and occasionally captures one to use in her potions and brews.)<br><br>Burdug orders her two followers to engage intruders while she attempts to neutralize a dangerous-looking combatant with a <em>command</em> spell. Then she casts <em>bless </em>on herself and the others, and finally casts <em>spiritual weapon </em>before joining battle.<br><br>If the fight goes poorly, Burdug throws alchemist’s fire (she has three flasks) and opens the door to area 10, releasing the stirges. She takes advantage of the confusion, using more alchemist’s fire if necessary, to escape and seek help.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> A character who makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check finds two leather sacks among the clutter, each containing 160 sp. If Burdug is defeated, the characters can recover any of her three flasks of alchemist’s fire that weren’t used.<br><br><strong><em>Secret Exit.</em></strong> A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to find the secret door on the west wall. It connects to the passage leading toward area 8; the secret door farther along the passage to the west isn’t concealed from this side.<br><hr><br><h3>10. The Grand Stair</h3><br><blockquote>The ceiling soars thirty feet high in the center of this impressive chamber, and the walls are carved with images of dwarves at their forges. Two large stone doors exit to the north and south. Several old skeletons lie scattered near the northern door. A gate of wrought iron stands in the western wall.<br><br>In the center of the floor, a natural rift descends sharply. Dozens of stone steps lead down into darkness. You can hear the distant sound of running water and a curious buzzing coming from far below.</blockquote><br>The easternmost chamber in the Mountain Door complex formerly served as the main entrance to the Glitterhame, which occupies the great natural caverns deeper in the hillside.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> If the characters aren’t trying to be quiet, four hungry<strong> <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhUW2Cj98EdXAWugR-\">stirges</a></strong> attack.<br><br><blockquote>The buzzing grows louder, and then four things resembling insectoid bats emerge from the stairwell and fly toward you!</blockquote><br>After reading the text above reveal <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdlyDadjtr-HESqcqP8\">Handout: Area 10</a> to your players.<br><br>Large quantities of smoke discourage the stirges, and they don’t move closer than 5 feet from a source of fire (including characters set alight by the trap described below). Sated stirges flap off to digest their meal down in area 15a of the Glitterhame.<br><br>The iron gate blocks entry from area 8 (see it for more information). The stairs in the rift lead down to the northwest end of area 15 in the Glitterhame.<br><br>The door to the south connects to area 9 and is locked from the other side. The lock can be picked from this side by someone who makes a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, but doing so pushes the key out on the other side and warns Burdug the shaman that someone’s coming.<br><br><strong><em>Fire Trap.</em></strong> The door to the north is carved in the image of a glowering dwarf’s face. Hinges are visible. On either side of the door, eight small spouts are carefully worked into the stonework about 10 feet above the floor.<br><br>The skeletons near the door are those of orcs killed by the trap long ago; their remains show signs of severe scorching. Rusted axe heads lie near the bodies, with no sign of the weapons’ hafts.<br><br>If the door is pulled open before the trap is disabled, a counterweight drops and pumps a flammable substance resembling alchemist’s fire from the spouts. Each creature within 15 feet of the door takes 10 (4d4) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. At the start of each of its turns thereafter, an affected creature takes 5 (2d4) fire damage. A creature can fight the flames around itself by making a successful DC 10 Dexterity check as an action; a successful check reduces the fire damage it takes at the start of each of its turns to 2 (1d4). Making another successful Dexterity check as an action quenches the flames around the creature entirely.<br><br>After the door is opened, the counterweight pulls it shut again in 2 rounds, resetting the trap. The characters can prevent this from happening by jamming the door open. If the trap resets, it can be activated only once more before its fiery substance is depleted.<br><br>The spouts on the wall can be detected by someone who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check afterward, a character deduces that they form part of a trap mechanism. A character who makes a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, or someone who tightly plugs the holes with durable material, renders the trap inactive. Someone who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check while examining the door identifies the counterweight mechanism that activates the trap; it can be deactivated afterward by someone who makes a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> Inspecting the small room behind the door reveals the full extent of the trap’s counterweight mechanism, as well as a system of pipes that connect the spouts to two 20-gallon copper drums (containing the substance for the fire trap).<br><br>A character who is proficient in the use of alchemist’s supplies might be able to craft alchemist’s fire from the dregs of the tanks. Doing so requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence check after the character finishes a long rest. On a successful check, the character salvages 1d4 flasks of alchemist’s fire. On a failed check, the reagents are mixed improperly, spoiling the batch; no further attempt to use these reagents can be made. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character is affected as though hit by alchemist’s fire.<br><br><hr><br><h3>11. Orc Quarters</h3><br><blockquote>Barrels, crates, and sacks line the walls of this chamber. Among the loot, four oversized straw pallets and other simple furnishings show that it now serves as a bunk room. Four bestial humanoids with feral eyes are cleaning their weapons and mending their gear; they spring to their feet and roar in challenge.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Four <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSfoDGOT0AnPY4AiF\">orcs</a></strong> live in an old guardroom. These orcs fight dirty. They team up into pairs, each focusing on one character. One orc in the pair attempts to shove the character, then the other attacks, hoping for a prone target.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The supplies stockpiled here are the same as those in areas 5 and 8: trade goods and staples raided from travelers and nearby settlements.<br><br>The orcs have 210 gp stashed in an old iron cauldron under vermin-infested bedding. A small pouch in another orc’s bedding contains a topaz worth 200 gp and two onyx stones worth 50 gp each. This loot isn’t well hidden; anyone searching the room can uncover it.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If the characters leave the complex before they have defeated <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSc-zrVIkGl4zZhpe\">Great Ulfe</a>, two of these orcs move to reinforce area 2 (reducing the number in this room to two) before the characters return.<br><hr><br><h3>12. Great Ulfe</h3><br><blockquote>A short flight of stairs leads up to a large, iron-bound door. A bloodstained human skull is fixed to the center of the door by an iron spike.</blockquote><br>The door isn’t locked, but it is heavy and hard to move; a successful DC 17 Strength check is needed to force it open.<br><br><blockquote>Beyond the door lies a small chamber covered in poorly cured animal hides and illuminated by smoking torches in bronze sconces. The smell is indescribable. A monstrous creature about ten feet in height steps forward, a massive axe in one hand. Two huge wolves strain at chains held closely in its other hand. “You think to challenge the Great Ulfe?” the creature booms. “Vak! Thrag! At them!”<br><br>It drops the chains and, as the wolves spring forward, it charges at you with a roar of rage.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSc-zrVIkGl4zZhpe\">Great Ulfe</a></strong> is a fierce <strong>ogre </strong>who leads the orcs of the Mountain Door. The chamber he claims as his own once belonged to the dwarf watch-captain.<br>If the characters fail to open the door on the first attempt, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSc-zrVIkGl4zZhpe\">Great Ulfe</a> is alerted to their presence. He releases his two <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhRk6d7VMM0-Z-wDIU\">dire wolves</a></strong>, Vak and Thrag, and takes the Ready action to attack the first enemy who enters the room. He is armed with a greataxe instead of a greatclub.<br><br><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSc-zrVIkGl4zZhpe\">Great Ulfe</a> neither asks nor gives quarter, but if the ogre falls, the wolves attempt to flee.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If the characters defeat <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSc-zrVIkGl4zZhpe\">Great Ulfe</a> but leave any orcs alive, one of the surviving orcs claims leadership of the tribe. If at least half the orcs in the tribe are slain in addition to Ulfe, any survivors abandon the dungeon after the party leaves. They become roving bands of raiders that the adventurers might have to deal with later.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSc-zrVIkGl4zZhpe\">Great Ulfe</a> keeps his hoard in two large wooden chests against the south wall: 440 gp, 1,600 sp, a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOvGd_HtwYWzLXUaKCS\">potion of climbing</a></em>, and a <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOrjtXOy85Exs_hCiMd\"><em>+1 rapier</em></a>. (The ogre would never stoop to wielding the delicate blade like some prancing bard.)<br><hr><br><h3>13. Dwarven Statue</h3><br><blockquote>At the end of the passage stands a statue of a fierce-looking dwarf in heavy mail armor. The stone warrior holds a sword in one hand and a smith’s hammer in the other. The statue is about seven feet tall and stands on a large stone pedestal.</blockquote><br>The statue is part of another trap designed to thwart invaders of the citadel. All the denizens of the Mountain Door know about the trap and avoid triggering it.<br><br>If any character approaches within 5 feet of the statue without disarming the trap, read:<br><br><blockquote>Suddenly, you feel a small click from the floor beneath your feet. The statue’s bearded face slides open, like an oversized nutcracker, and greenish gas billows forth.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Poison Gas Trap.</em></strong> A pressure plate is set into the floor about 5 feet in front of the statue. When at least 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, it depresses into the floor, opening the statue’s face to reveal a nozzle from which poison gas sprays out in a 15-foot cone. Each affected creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the creature finishes a short rest.<br><br>Someone who examines the proper location and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the pressure plate. A successful DC 12 Dexterity check by a character using thieves’ tools disarms the trap; the pressure plate can also be deactivated by physically jamming it so that it can’t move.<br><br>If the trap isn’t deactivated, it resets automatically after 1 minute.<br><br><hr><br><h3>14. Bunk Room</h3>A large chamber, once the principal bunk room for dwarf guards posted in this part of the dungeon, has been appropriated by Great Ulfe’s orcs. Up to eleven of the creatures live here, but at the moment a group of them are out raiding the countryside nearby, and three others are on duty in area 4.<br><br><blockquote>This chamber is filled with rough-hewn bunks, tables, and chairs, and the floor is strewn with filthy pelts. At first glance it appears that a dozen or so humanoids might use this area as a sleeping quarters.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Only Old Yarrack the <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSmIk7y_UC6bG5CO6\">orog</a></strong> and four <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSfoDGOT0AnPY4AiF\">orcs</a> </strong>are at home when the characters enter the chamber. They enter combat as soon as they’re aware of intruders.<br><br>If the battle goes poorly for the orcs, Old Yarrack orders an orc to break off and summon help from area 9. If things get desperate, he sends for help from the orcs in area 11. If the orcs here fall, Yarrack attempts to join Great Ulfe’s forces in area 12. The orog carries a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOuZOZ8F6tpvRDI-Ioo\">potion of healing</a></em> and drinks it if his current hit points drop to one-fourth his hit point maximum or lower.<br><br><strong><em>Secret Door.</em></strong> The orcs don’t know about the secret door in the western wall, but a character who searches the spot can discover it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> Two days after the characters arrive, the first raiding party returns and reinforces this room with four more orcs. Thus, the party might encounter as many as nine creatures in this room.<br><br>Any orcs slain in area 4 are replaced by orcs from this room, if any survive.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> A successful DC 10 Wisdom check reveals a loose stone on the south wall, concealing a sack that holds 250 sp and 40 gp, along with a handaxe that bears Durgeddin’s smith-mark. Aside from his <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOuZOZ8F6tpvRDI-Ioo\">potion of healing</a></em>, Old Yarrack keeps his personal treasure in area 8.<br><br>Old Yarrack carries the key to the cage door in area 6.<br>"

            "gmnotes": "<h2>The Glitterhame</h2>Below the Mountain Door lies the Glitterhame, a large series of natural caverns in the heart of the Stone Tooth. The caverns are beautiful: the walls sparkle and glisten with flecks of semiprecious stone, and millennia of sculpting and erosion by water have created sheets of fluted flowstone, delicate stalactites, and majestic stalagmites. Water streams down through the caverns toward an underground river far below.<br><br>The Glitterhame is now home to a band of troglodytes, dangerous reptilian savages that haunt underground places. The troglodytes and Great Ulfe’s tribe maintain an uneasy peace, although skirmishes occur. The troglodytes usually use the old orc tunnel (see area 21) to hunt on the surface and leave the orcs alone. In return, Great Ulfe’s followers rarely invade the troglodytes’ domain.<br><br>The following locations are identified on the map in this handout.<br><hr><br><h3>15. The Cold Stream</h3>If the characters take the steps down from area 10, they emerge into a narrow tunnel with a subterranean stream flowing across it.<br><br><blockquote>The stairway twists and turns a long way downward. The floor has been cut into hundreds of shallow steps, but the walls and ceiling are still natural rock. About sixty feet down, a rushing stream spills from a narrow crack to the south and crosses the stairway, disappearing into a narrow, winding tunnel to the north. The rill is only two or three feet wide.</blockquote><br>If the characters explore the route taken by the stream, they have to go single file as they wade through the water. The bed of the fast-moving stream slants sharply; each character must make a successful DC 8 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to descend safely. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character falls, tumbling 20 feet downhill and taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><hr><br><h3>15a. Stirge Colony</h3><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Stirges have made their nest in a small cave overlooking the stream, about halfway down the passage. Fissures at the back of the cave run 150 feet to the surface, but nothing larger than a stirge can fit through. Six <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhUW2Cj98EdXAWugR-\">stirges</a></strong> are sleeping in the nest, but any noise or light from a party descending the streambed wakes them. Each round after the characters enter the cave, 1d4 stirges wake and attack, until all are active.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> On the floor at the back of the stirge cave lies the desiccated corpse of a dwarf explorer who died here many years ago—part of the failed expedition. A leather pouch on its belt contains 35 gp.<br><hr><br><h3>16. High Cavern</h3>The first chamber of the Glitterhame proper is bisected by the stream and has a number of routes leading away from it.<br><br><blockquote>The descending fissure opens up abruptly into a very high cavern, its ceiling easily forty feet or more overhead. The stairway continues to wind down along a ledge that follows the north wall of the chamber. A fast-moving stream about five feet wide runs across the floor of the chamber from the north and disappears under a low stone overhang to the south, and larger passageways exit to the southeast and the northeast.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Four <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhUW2Cj98EdXAWugR-\">stirges</a> </strong>are clinging to the chamber walls high overhead. They can see any light source that is brought into this chamber, but they are very hard to spot in turn, owing to the height of the ceiling. The stirges have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide unless a character specifically looks for danger overhead, so they might surprise the party.<br><br>The stream exits the south wall of the cavern through a passage only 3 feet high, half filled by water, which serves as an entrance to the troglodytes’ lair (area 17). Anyone who searches the stream’s banks finds the footprints of Medium reptilian creatures and tracks left by tails with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check.<br><br>To reach area 17 from this cave, a Medium or larger character must crouch down and then wade or crawl through the stream. Torches and lanterns are difficult to keep lit, since the lowest point of the ceiling in this passage is only about 6 inches above the water’s surface.<br><hr><br><h3>17. Troglodyte Cavern</h3>The troglodytes that infest the Glitterhame have claimed one of the largest caverns as a common room and food storage area. They defend it against all intruders. Characters coming from area 16 might not be able to see everything at first.<br><br><blockquote>Floundering through the cold, swift stream, you emerge in a huge cavern. The ceiling must be thirty feet overhead, and the far end of the cave is lost in darkness. A foul stench assaults your nostrils immediately. The remnants of butchered game animals hang from crude wooden stakes along the cavern walls, and you spot a pair of orc corpses treated in the same fashion.</blockquote><br>The grisly trophies that decorate the room represent about two or three weeks’ worth of meals for the troglodyte tribe. The troglodytes like to let their meat age a bit before eating it, so most of the carcasses here are appallingly decayed.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Two <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhUd1fWt_XcPu9qQn3\">troglodytes</a></strong> are hiding in the northern end of this area, one on each side of the stream. Their Chameleon Skin trait gives them advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. They attack as soon as two characters have entered the area, likely achieving surprise.<br><br><strong><em>Mud-and-Wattle Door.</em></strong> The troglodytes have blocked the southwest passage leading to the main warren (area 18) with a crude plug made of mud and wattle. A successful DC 10 Strength check is required to pull it open. If alerted by the sounds of battle, the troglodytes on the far side secure the door, increasing the DC of the check to 15.<br><br><strong><em>Pool.</em></strong> The stream flows through the center of the cavern, growing somewhat wider and deeper until it reaches the southeast corner. The pool in that location is about 20 feet across and about 10 feet deep in the middle.<br><br>Along the eastern edge of the pool, a short passage leading to area 23 has been blocked up with loose rubble and mud, creating a rough stone wall 10 feet across. Characters can break through this barrier with some effort; it has AC 16 and 50 hit points per 5-foot segment.<br><br><hr><br><h3>18. Troglodyte Warren</h3>Most of the troglodytes dwell in a group of dismal caverns, occupying three caves that branch off the warren’s central area to the northwest, southwest, and southeast.<br><br><blockquote>The passage opens into a long, low cavern that has three narrow, twisting passages leading off into darkness. Numerous rock columns rise to meet the stone overhead. The air is thick with troglodyte stench, and the floor is littered with refuse from the monsters’ meals and gnawed bones of dubious origin.<br><br>Something scrapes and hisses in the dark, and you hear the soft padding of scaly feet on rock.</blockquote><br>Characters who are being stealthy might catch the troglodytes unawares. If the characters are carrying any light sources or making a lot of noise when they enter, the troglodytes in the west and southeast chambers are alerted. As soon as any fighting begins, one troglodyte attempts to escape to the north, toward area 19, and summon <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdlBzHAJWGMv8e_TD_o\">Kaarghaz</a>, the chieftain.<br><br><strong><em>Northwest Chamber.</em></strong> Two <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhUd1fWt_XcPu9qQn3\">troglodytes</a></strong> are sleeping in the small cave to the northwest when the characters enter area 18.<br><br><strong><em>Southwest Chamber.</em></strong> The females tend the colony’s eggs and raise hatchlings in the southwest cave. Six <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhUd1fWt_XcPu9qQn3\">troglodytes</a></strong> defend the hatchery and fight to the death to defend their young.<br><br>The chamber also contains two dozen noncombatant hatchlings, which scurry away from intruders. Characters receive no XP for slaughtering them.<br><br><strong><em>Southeast Chamber.</em></strong> Three <strong></strong><strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhUd1fWt_XcPu9qQn3\">troglodytes</a> </strong>recently returned from the hunt are relaxing in the southeast cave. Unless they are alerted to the characters’ presence, they are concentrating on devouring what’s left of a small deer.<br><br><strong><em>Tactics.</em></strong> If the characters attack the troglodytes in the northwest or southeast chamber, those in the other chamber hear the sounds of battle and rush to assist. The troglodytes in the southwest chamber remain there to protect the hatchlings; if the characters attack the hatchery first, all the troglodytes from the other chambers come to join the fight.<br><br><hr><br><h3>19. Chieftain’s Cave</h3>The door leading north from area 18 is a mud-and-wattle barrier wedged in place; a successful DC 10 Strength check is required to pull it aside.<br><br><blockquote>Glowing coals in a crude hearth illuminate this large cave. The ceiling here rises about fifteen feet above the floor, and rubbish and skins cover the floor. A lizard the size of a small horse rises and slowly slithers toward you.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> The chief of the troglodytes, <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdlBzHAJWGMv8e_TD_o\">Kaarghaz</a></strong>, occupies the chamber along with his pet <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSIjareTYqZiFGA0u\">giant lizard</a></strong>.<br><br>If the characters make a lot of noise or tip off their presence in some other way, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdlBzHAJWGMv8e_TD_o\">Kaarghaz</a> begins this encounter invisible (see below). Otherwise, read:<br><br><blockquote>Behind the lizard, a hulking, scaly-skinned creature easily a foot taller than any of the others you’ve seen glares at you and snarls.</blockquote><br>If <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdlBzHAJWGMv8e_TD_o\">Kaarghaz</a> is alerted to the party’s approach, he casts <em>invisibility</em> on himself before they enter. If he loses at least half his hit points, he tries to escape (using <em>invisibility</em> if possible). If his escape succeeds, he soon afterward rounds up a war party of surviving troglodytes from other areas to track down and ambush the party.<br><br><strong><em>Negotiation.</em></strong> <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdlBzHAJWGMv8e_TD_o\">Kaarghaz</a> starts out hostile and won’t become friendly to the characters. Nevertheless, a character who speaks Draconic might be able to stave off combat by parleying with the chieftain. For example, the characters might have captured some of the hatchlings in the southwest chamber, intending to ransom them back to the troglodytes in exchange for treasure. Even if <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdlBzHAJWGMv8e_TD_o\">Kaarghaz</a> can be convinced to give up some of his wealth, he doesn’t let the matter rest—he forms a war party (as described above) and goes after the characters.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The chief’s chamber is strewn with trophies, including the skulls, bones, hides, and weapons of defeated foes. Amid the mess, a small square of black silk hides a ruby worth 300 gp. It can be found with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. A battered wooden chest with leather hasps holds 1,500 sp.<br><hr><br><h3>20. Scaly Lair</h3><br><blockquote>The swift stream passes over a steep slab of bedrock in front of a short passage. The cave beyond is long and low, with an uneven ceiling about ten feet high. In the southern end of the room, an enormous white-scaled lizard lunges and snaps, but you can see that a sturdy chain around its neck tethers it in place. The agitated creature twists in frustration, its tail lashing.<br><br>Behind the lizard lie a couple of iron chests.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> The cavern holds the troglodytes’ secret weapon—a freshly captured <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kdh_c1Xior9jYqRgF5u\">giant subterranean lizard</a></strong>. Although the lizard is chained, it can attack anyone who comes within its reach. It strikes with its tail first, hoping to knock a target prone, then snaps at it with its powerful jaws to gulp it down.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The two chests contain a total of 2,200 sp. One holds a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOvGd_HtwYWzLXUaKCS\">potion of climbing</a></em>, and the other a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOzx5qRgx3kQGjAWI18\">potion of water breathing</a></em>.<br><hr><br><h3>21. Orc Tunnel</h3><br><blockquote>Several passages branch away from this large, high-ceilinged cavern. To the north, a carved, square-mouthed tunnel shows that someone has been at work in these caves. A gate of rough-hewn timber blocks a small passage to the northeast. Three other passageways wind off toward the south. A heavy animal smell lingers in the air.</blockquote><br>A hundred years ago, the orcs besieging Khundrukar tunneled into the dwarven stronghold. The cavern they emerged in now serves as a guard post and a mustering point for troglodyte raiders.<br><br>The tunnel in the northern end of the area runs about 500 feet and opens on the hillside (see <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdlQOCvLsalE_r-f5FX\">Approaching Khundrukar</a>). The troglodytes use the opening to raid and hunt on the surface.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> In the northern part of the cavern, near the passages that run east and west, two <strong></strong><strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhUd1fWt_XcPu9qQn3\">troglodytes</a> </strong>are hiding. From their Chameleon Skin trait, they have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide. The troglodyte on the west side waits for an opportune moment to attack intruders with surprise. The other moves east to the gate and opens it to release a <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhRYiTAMd8u1TKR1jk\">brown bear</a></strong>, which attacks any non-troglodyte in the next round (roll initiative for the bear when it is released).<br><br><strong><em>Bear Pen.</em></strong> A sturdy timber gate, latched on the outside, seals a smaller cave to the east. The bear attacks any non-troglodyte that opens the cage door, then tries to escape through the tunnel.<br><br>The animal isn’t trained but has come to expect food from the troglodytes. It is hostile toward strangers, but someone proficient in Animal Handling might be able to calm it down with a DC 15 Wisdom check. If the check succeeds and no troglodytes remain nearby, the characters can release it safely and let it depart.<br><br><hr><br><h3>22. Fungus Cavern</h3><br><blockquote>A trickle of water seeping down from the hillside above reaches this irregular cavern, nourishing a profusion of fungus—weird puffballs, tall caps, and patches of fuzzy mold in a variety of colors. A golden-brown carpet of mold covers an old skeleton in rusted mail in the southern part of the room, and a narrow passageway leads to another small room beyond this one. A surprisingly bright sword gleams in the skeleton’s bony grasp.</blockquote><br>When the characters enter this area, reveal <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kdm5xuq97MI7P24w9yI\">Handout: Area 22</a>.<br><br><strong><em>Hazard.</em></strong> The skeleton that the characters first see is that of a dwarf. From its location, it’s possible for someone to see a second skeleton (human) in the south end of the chamber. Both skeletons are covered with a particularly virulent form of mold. A character can identify the threat with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check.<br><br>If either skeleton is touched, the mold ejects a cloud of spores that fill a 10-foot cube originating from the skeleton. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of this time, unless the poisoned condition is removed, the creature must repeat the saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Exposing a patch of the mold to sunlight or dealing any fire damage to it destroys it.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The dwarf skeleton clutches a <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOrjtXOy85Exs_hCiMd\"><em>+1 longsword</em></a> that bears Durgeddin’s smith-mark. The human skeleton wears a steel helmet chased with silver, worth 110 gp.<br><hr><br><h3>23. Dwarven Sepulchers</h3><br><blockquote>You gaze into an extremely large cave faintly lit by natural phosphorescence. Its ceiling rises fifty feet high in places. Crystals glimmer softly in the eerie light. Weird, beautiful flows and structures of delicate stone grace the chamber. The western portion of the great cave is separated from the rest by a steep bluff; the ceiling here is half the height of the rest of the chamber.<br><br>A couple dozen large stone sepulchers line the cavern walls, each carved with intricate reliefs and designs and marked with Dwarvish runes.</blockquote> <br>The upper portion of the great cavern was intended to be the final resting place of Durgeddin’s clan.<br><br>Durgeddin and his followers feared that their war against the orcs would ultimately claim them all, so they built their own tombs during the first phase of carving out the stronghold. Ironically, only a handful of the dwarves were ever interred here; the rest lie where they fell when the orcs stormed Khundrukar.<br><br>The troglodytes have a superstitious fear of the tombs and refuse to set foot in this part of the Glitterhame. They don’t pursue characters who enter this area.<br><br>If the characters investigate the tombs at greater length, read:<br><br> <blockquote>Twenty-three sepulchers stand here. The lids are carved in the likenesses of grim dwarves in armor. Dwarvish runes on the front of each tomb appear to represent the names of the occupants or the intended occupants. Three of the stone coffins have additional runes carved into them.</blockquote> <br>If someone in the party can read Dwarvish, the following details become apparent:<br><br><blockquote>The additional runes record the occupant’s date of death and the great deeds the dwarf performed in life. Also carved into these three coffins is a warning that doom awaits any who dare to defile the honorable dead.<br><br>The names on these three sepulchers are those of Borgol the Old, Gharin Orc-Doom, and Numik the Unlucky.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Each tomb is a marble vault 6 feet long, 4 feet high, and 3 feet wide, with a heavy stone lid. Despite the warnings carved on the tombs, there is no danger here. Even if the characters disturb Borgol, Gharin, or Numik, all they find are old bones and no undead.<br><br>The three dwarves were buried with little funerary wealth; Durgeddin’s folk believed in honoring their dead with stone, not riches. Borgol’s remains include a ring of gold in the shape of a dragon holding its tail in its mouth, worth 120 gp. Gharin was buried with a finely crafted warhammer inset with a garnet, worth 110 gp. The warhammer features Durgeddin's smith-mark.<br><hr><br><h3>24. The Glitterhame</h3><br><blockquote>This great cavern glimmers with a faint phosphorescence. The ceiling is almost fifty feet overhead, and bright flecks and gleaming stone formations are visible in the distance. Patches of strange fungi dot the floor, including capped stalks standing as tall as a human and glowing puffballs almost a yard wide.<br><br>High ledges rise fifteen to twenty feet above the floor on the north, south, and west walls. Narrow passageways lead off to the north and the south, and a flight of carved stone stairs descends from the western ledge to a path that meanders through the center of the chamber toward a small iron door in the eastern wall. Audible throughout the entire chamber is the sigh of a soft, cool breeze that rises toward the surface far above.</blockquote><br>The fungal growths are harmless. In fact, the stalks and the puffballs are edible, if not especially tasty. The danger lies in the grick nest that overlooks the path.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Two <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSTqNHhlnoocgMhZ2\">gricks</a></strong> lurk in the 20-foot-high rockfall that spills down from area 26, at the place where the path leading east comes closest to the slope. They are wedged into spaces between boulders, 6 to 8 feet above the cavern floor. Their Stone Camouflage trait gives them advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, so they might surprise the party.<br><br>The gricks attack anyone who travels on the path next to the rockfall or climbs anywhere along the slope that leads to area 26. Any character trying to scale the rockfall while under attack must succeed on a DC 8 Strength (Athletics) check to make progress. If the characters reach area 26 by some other means, the gricks move to attack them there.<br><hr><br><h3>25. Long Cavern</h3><br><blockquote>The thunderous roar of falling water fills this long, low chamber, and spray makes everything slick and wet. A fast stream rushes through the center of the cavern, emerging from beneath a crude dam of rock and mud in the western wall. The stream disappears into a dark shaft at the cavern’s eastern end. A rough, winding path follows the stream toward the east.</blockquote><br>The chamber runs from the troglodyte warrens to a natural shaft on the east end that leads down into the Sinkhole (see area 28). The stream spills over the edge of the shaft in a subterranean waterfall, and near the waterfall a narrow, winding stairwell leads down.<br><br><strong><em>Slippery Slope.</em></strong> The smooth cavern floor slopes down toward the stream, and much of the area immediately north of the stream is covered with a thin layer of slime. The slime makes the floor very slippery. Its presence can be discerned with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check.<br><br>Any creature that enters the slippery slope or starts its move there must make a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. A creature that fails the check falls prone and slides southward toward the stream at half its walking speed. The stream is flowing fast enough that anyone who falls in must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw to avoid being swept over the waterfall.<br><br>A creature that goes over the waterfall lands in a pool 60 feet below (see area 28), taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and suffering one level of exhaustion.<br><hr><br><h3>26. Grick Lair</h3><br><blockquote>A rocky ledge sits at the top of a steep, irregular rockfall about twenty feet high. The mouth of a side cavern leads into darkness beyond.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> The two <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSTqNHhlnoocgMhZ2\">gricks</a></strong> hidden in the rockfall (see area 24) make their lair at the end of a passage that winds north from the ledge. They are encountered here if they retreated to attack characters who got past them.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The gricks discarded the inedible portions of their victims in the back of the cave. Rooting through the grisly remains uncovers a suit of scale mail and scattered coins totaling 200 cp, 180 sp, and 60 gp.<br><hr><br><h3>27. Iron Door</h3>The entrance to Durgeddin’s halls and forges lies behind a sturdy locked door.<br><br><blockquote>Cut into the cavern wall is a small but strong-looking door of iron plates, about five feet tall and four feet wide. Heavy rivets stud its surface, and a tarnished silver rune—Durgeddin’s smith-mark—gleams on the door’s rusted face.</blockquote><br>The door consists of two pieces of sheet iron bolted to a strong frame. A pintle is fitted through the door’s middle, so it has no hinges. It can be opened with the key on the dwarf skeleton in the prison (see area 34). A character can pick the lock with thieves’ tools and a successful DC 18 Dexterity check. Breaking the door down is very difficult, requiring a successful DC 25 Strength check.<br><br>On the other side of the door is a steep staircase that leads up to area 35 in the Foundry.<br>"

The black dragon Nightscale sometimes swims through its submerged areas, using the river as a back door to its lair.<br><br>A narrow staircase winds down along the chasm walls until reaching bottom, where it offers access to area 28.<br><br>The following locations are identified on the map in this handout.<br><hr><br><h3>28. Waterfall Cavern</h3><br><blockquote>A loud waterfall spills down the northwest wall of this cavern into a deep pool. The rocky walls glisten with spray, and a weird array of colorful minerals and strange lichens lend an unearthly beauty to this spot. A fast-moving stream runs south from the pool at the base of the falls, and a nearby natural passage heads in the same direction. A set of narrow stairs cut into the rock wind up to the north, and two old wooden doors stand in a wall of dressed stone to the east.</blockquote> <br>The stream flowing from area 25 in the Glitterhame pours down into the chamber.<br><br>The pool is populated by harmless blind fish and white crustaceans but contains nothing dangerous. The outflowing stream drains into the river in area 29. Any characters who fell into the pool are carried by the current toward the outflow at about 20 feet per round. A character who ends up in the river might be swept away; see <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdmAHvz_Si-FDZcP1Nr\">Fast-Flowing Water</a>.<br><hr><br><h3>29. River Cavern</h3><br><blockquote>This long, narrow cavern is half-filled with an underground river, flowing along at a rapid pace. A narrow ledge on the north side overlooks the river. A bridge of stone spans the river, leading to a larger ledge on the south side that follows the course of the river to the east.</blockquote><br>The underground river flows swiftly from east to west. The bridge is sturdy and sound; there’s no danger in crossing it.<br><br><strong><em>Watery Peril.</em></strong> At the west end of the cavern, the ceiling lowers to meet the surface of the river. Any creature swept past this point by the current is trapped in a long, airless underground channel and is likely to drown (see <a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/The%20Environment#h-Suffocating\">Suffocating</a>). In addition, the creature must make a successful DC 12 Strength saving throw each round or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage as it is battered by rocks. Even creatures that can breathe water aren’t likely to survive for long.<br><br>The stream runs underground for about 5 miles before emerging on a hillside to the west of the Stone Tooth.<br><br><hr><br><h3>30. Old Storeroom</h3>The northern door in area 28 has swollen shut from dampness. A successful DC 10 Strength check is required to force it open. Durgeddin’s folk formerly used the large chamber beyond as a storeroom.<br><br><blockquote>The door gives way grudgingly, revealing a low chamber of dressed stone. This chamber is filled with what appears to be rotten food—barrels of salted meat gone bad, sacks of flour or grain covered in russet-colored mold, tuns of cider turned to vinegar.<br><br>Two open archways in the east wall lead to a similar room, and two more openings are dimly visible beyond. The floor just past the first archway gleams wetly.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> None of the supplies are salvageable. While searching, the characters might blunder into a <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSO6V26zUilKV2rVT\">gray ooze</a></strong> that occupies the middle chamber of the three.<br><br>While motionless, the ooze is indistinguishable from a patch of wet stone. It is alerted when characters force open the door, and it strikes at the first character who enters the middle chamber, attacking with surprise.<br><br><blockquote>What appeared to be a wet patch on the floor suddenly twists like a snake and lunges toward you! </blockquote><br><hr><br><h3>31. Empty Storeroom</h3>The southern door in area 28 is swollen shut and requires a successful DC 10 Strength check to open. The chamber on the other side of the door resembles area 30, but it is empty. The orcs broke in and carried off most of its contents during the fall of Khundrukar.<br><br><hr><br><h3>32. Flooded Storeroom</h3>A year or so ago, a season of heavy rains on the surface raised the level of the subterranean river to create a minor flood. Water still stands at the bottom of the stairs.<br><br><blockquote>A short flight of stone steps leads down to a wooden door that stands half-open. Dark, stagnant water pools in the small landing at the base of the steps and in the doorway, presumably filling the room beyond as well. The area smells of rot.</blockquote> <br><strong><em>Diseased Pool.</em></strong> The water is about 5 feet deep and is tainted by disease. Anyone who drinks the water or wades into it is exposed and must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to avoid infection. Symptoms manifest one day after exposure and include high fever, muscle spasms, and eventual paralysis.<br><br>An infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion when it finishes the first long rest it takes after being exposed. Whenever it finishes a long rest thereafter, it must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers another level of exhaustion. On a successful save, its exhaustion level is reduced by one. If its exhaustion level reaches 5, the infected creature becomes paralyzed until the disease is cured or the effect is removed with a <em>lesser restoration</em> spell or similar magic. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s exhaustion level to 0, the creature recovers from the disease.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Submerged in the corner of the eastern vault is the skeleton of an orc killed a century ago. The skeleton rests atop a rotted leather pouch that contains a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOzx5qRgx3kQGjAWI18\">potion of water breathing</a></em> and a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOq3pByx1oTZkV0YcTB\">potion of invisibility</a></em>.<br><hr><br><h3>33. Roper’s Cavern</h3><br><blockquote>The rock stairs climb steeply, turn north, and then descend toward the east into a cavern very much like the one you just left, but smaller. A ledge along the river continues east to a door on the north wall, and the rushing river separates you from a ledge on the southern side.<br><br>A large, strange-looking stalagmite stands in the middle of the southern ledge. A cave fish flops helplessly on the bank nearby.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> The southern ledge is the home of a ravenous <strong>roper </strong>that has been feeding on fish from the stream. Unsatisfied with this diet, the roper is eager for larger prey.<br><br>Even characters who look closely at the roper can’t tell that it’s anything other than a stalagmite unless it moves. The roper is difficult to sneak up on. If a character manages to approach without alerting it, continue:<br><br><blockquote>A strand extends from the stalagmite, with the thrashing cave fish in its grasp. It pulls the fish toward the rock formation—and then, suddenly, a fang-filled maw gapes open in the stalagmite and devours the fish in one bite. </blockquote><br>After reading the text above reveal <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kdm9Z-uHrzxtHfmQH6B\">Handout: Area 33</a> to your players.<br><br>The roper attacks when any character gets at least 20 feet into the cave, gaining surprise if its presence hasn’t been revealed. It can target up to four characters with its tendrils, possibly pulling those it has grappled into the rushing river. Characters in the water have advantage on checks to escape the grapple due to the force of the current. The river poses a severe hazard in itself, though; see <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdmAHvz_Si-FDZcP1Nr\">Fast-Flowing Water</a>.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> The roper is satisfied, ending the attack, after it devours one Small or larger creature. It can’t speak or understand languages, but it has a bestial intelligence and might be persuaded to accept a substitute meal. As long as the food is alive, the roper isn’t picky.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Cutting open the roper’s stony gizzard reveals a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kdhb1OlYxnjzpAedmwe\">ring of spell storing</a></em> and six gemstones: a ruby worth 1,000 gp, two emeralds worth 400 gp each, and three serpentines worth 60 gp apiece.<br><hr><br><h3>34. Prison</h3>If the characters get past the roper in area 33, they can explore an area that was used as a prison in Durgeddin’s day.<br><br><blockquote>A sturdy door of iron plate stands open in the north wall of the cavern. Inside you see a short passageway with three small iron doors set into the west wall. The first two are open, but the door at the end of the hall is closed.</blockquote><br>The door to the northern cell is locked. With a search of the grimy floor and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Pereption) check, a character discovers an old jailer’s key that fits the lock. Otherwise, the lock can be picked by someone who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.<br><br>The first two cells are empty. The locked cell holds the skeletal remains of a dwarf in rusted plate armor. This individual was one of Durgeddin’s chief lieutenants; the orcs captured her during the final battle and threw her in this cell for interrogation later. Afterward, the unfortunate warrior was forgotten and left to starve.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The suit of plate is too corroded to be of any use, but a search of the corpse produces a small silk purse containing 8 pp and a key that opens the iron door in area 27.<br>"

Most of this part of the complex was thoroughly ransacked when the dwarven citadel fell.<br><br>Unlike the Mountain Door or the Glitterhame, which offer exits to the surface world, the Foundry isn&#x2019;t readily accessible. The area isn&#x2019;t abandoned, though. Undead horrors wait in its darkest recesses, and dwarf-crafted traps still work perfectly well despite their age. In addition, a small number of duergar have come here to breathe life into Durgeddin&#x2019;s old forges and decipher the secrets of the master smith&#x2019;s work.<br><br>If the characters come to this part of the complex from the Black Lake (see <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdlQOCvLsalE_r-f5FX\">Approaching Khundrukar</a>), they begin in area 38.<br><br>The following locations are identified on the map in this handout.<br><hr><br><h3>35. Chamber of Statues</h3>In the corridor behind the iron door in area 27, a flight of steep stone stairs climbs 30 feet northward.<br><br><blockquote>The stairs end at the entrance to an octagonal chamber. The floor is inlaid with cracked, dusty blue tiles, and the walls are dressed with polished marble. Large doors of iron-bound oak exit to the northwest and northeast.<br><br>Three cast bronze statues, almost ten feet tall, stand by the west, north, and east walls. Each depicts an armed dwarf. The eastern and western ones carry axes and shields. The center statue is armed with two axes. The ceiling rises in a dome almost thirty feet above the floor.<br><br>From somewhere in the distance, you can hear the faint ringing of hammer on anvil.</blockquote><br>After reading the text above reveal <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdmBF-RI_dJ8zIzAdJj\">Handout: Area 35</a> to your players.<br><br>The sound of the hammering comes from beyond the east wall, as can be determined with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Anyone who examines the floor notices that the dust is somewhat disturbed. A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals an infrequently used trail that leads from the entrance stairs to the stone wall behind the east statue.<br><br><strong><em>Statue Trap.</em></strong> The obvious exits to the northeast and northwest are false doors that open onto blank stone. Pulling on either door releases a catch that causes the axe-wielding hands of the two closest statues to drop. Any creature within 5 feet of a door when it is opened is subjected to two melee attacks: +5 to hit; 9 (2d8) slashing damage on a hit.<br><br>With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can discern small scorings on the floor in front of a door, left by earlier axe strokes. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check enables a character to deduce that the doors aren&#x2019;t what they seem, through small clues showing that they are unused. The same check focused on a statue can reveal a small line on the arm that holds an axe, indicating the arm&#x2019;s ability to move.<br><br>A character who makes a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves&#x2019; tools can jam a statue&#x2019;s arm so that the axe can&#x2019;t swing. Destroying a statue (AC 18, 60 hit points, immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage) also disables its attack.<br><br>Once a statue has attacked, the trap must be reset manually. If any duergar survive and remain here, they reset the trap within a day after it has been triggered.<br><br><strong><em>Secret Stairwell.</em></strong> The secret door behind the east statue is well hidden, requiring a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot. If the characters detected the faint trail that leads there, a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check locates the door. Beyond is a flight of stone stairs that leads upward.<br><br>The stairs have been warded with a magical alarm. When a creature ascends past the halfway point of the staircase, a <em>magic mouth</em> spell calls out in Dwarvish, &#x201C;Alert! Alert! Intruders approach!&#x201D; This sound warns the duergar guards in area 36.<br><br><hr><br><h3>36. The Great Hall</h3>At the top of the stairs from area 35 is a stone door carved with a glowering dwarf&#x2019;s face. It opens easily.<br><br><blockquote>This enormous hall is lined with ten great pillars, carved into the forms of giants and dragons, that support the vaulted ceiling high above. Guttering orange torches set in sconces along the walls illuminate the room, and a mighty throne sits on a dais at the opposite end. The walls were once covered with tile mosaics, but they have been smashed and defiled by graffiti. Tiny fragments of tile litter the floor. You can see five other exits.<br><br>A small fire smolders on the floor before the dais, where six sleeping pallets lie empty, surrounded by packs and supplies. The sound of hammers ringing on iron comes from beyond the doors to the south.<br><br>Suddenly a harsh voice calls from the shadows of the pillars, &#x201C;Go back the way you came! This is the only warning you&#x2019;ll get!&#x201D;</blockquote><br>The cavern was formerly Durgeddin&#x2019;s throne room, banquet hall, and center of authority. Its ceiling is 30 feet high, and the sconces are 10 feet above the floor. The throne is unremarkable: a short bench of stone that might have been decorated at some point in the past. The graffiti consists of crude epithets in the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSfoDGOT0AnPY4AiF\">Orc</a> language insulting dwarves and their ancestry.<br><br>Creatures. Two <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSE7xP7jPFqoADngq\">duergar</a></strong> guards and Ghared, a <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kdh_m4kYUr1wXEQzAb3\">duergar spy</a></strong>, stand watch here. Unless the party climbed the stairs from area 35 without triggering the <em>magic mouth</em>, the duergar are invisible.<br><br><strong><em>Negotiation.</em></strong> The duergar start hostile but wait to see if the characters attack. Ghared shouts the initial warning and speaks for the group; she&#x2019;s suspicious, greedy, and arrogant, but not stupid. She is willing to give information to the party if a character succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. The characters can change her attitude to indifferent, reducing the check DC to 10, with a suitable bribe (at least 100 gp).<br><br>Ghared can share any of the following information if the party succeeds in getting her to converse:<br><br><ul><li>The doors to the north lead to halls infested with undead and cursed magic.</li><li>The door to the southwest leads into the old kitchens, guarded by more cursed magic.</li><li>A dragon lives in a large lake cavern deep below.</li><li>The subterranean river flows from the lake through other parts of the complex below the Glitterhame. It&#x2019;s fed from a lake on the surface.</li></ul><br>If negotiations are successful, the duergar are willing to let the party enter the rooms to the north. With a sufficiently high Charisma (Persuasion) check and an indifferent attitude from Ghared, the characters can get the duergar to escort them to the entrance to the dragon&#x2019;s territory (the chasm in area 38). The duergar will not allow the party into the bladeworks (area 37) without an escort, and they prohibit entry into area 39.<br><br>If the characters don&#x2019;t negotiate, or if talks go badly, combat ensues.<br><br><strong><em>Tactics.</em></strong> If combat occurs, the duerger guards first attack with their javelins. They use their Enlarge ability in the next round, taking cover behind two of the pillars before wading into melee.<br><br>Meanwhile, Ghared remains invisible and maneuvers to make a sneak attack, then enlarges herself after she becomes visible. She has a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOuZOZ8F6tpvRDI-Ioo\">potion of healing</a></em>, which she uses if her current hit points drop to half her hit point maximum or lower.<br><br>If two duergar fall in battle, the survivor tries to retreat to area 37 or 39.<br><hr><br><h3>37. The Bladeworks</h3>In what was Durgeddin&#x2019;s smithy and workplace, the duergar are currently engaged in a secret project, hoping to capture a spark of the master smith&#x2019;s vengeful magic.<br><br><blockquote>Double stone doors lead into a barrel-vaulted area containing several furnaces. The eastern end of the chamber continues into a large, dark cave, from which a cold wind moans. A stream of water rushes from west to east through the center of the room, crossed by two stone bridges. On the other side of the stream, three bald, gray dwarves work at a roaring forge, beating a white-hot blade into shape on an old anvil.</blockquote><br>After reading the text above reveal <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdmFaAV42hesoxF7jj4\">Handout: Area 37</a> to your players<br><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Two <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSE7xP7jPFqoADngq\">duergar</a></strong> smiths are forging a blade at the forge in the center of the south wall. The work is overseen by <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kdl6K3Qp5OGl6Vey79p\">Snurrevin</a></strong>.<br><br><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kdl6K3Qp5OGl6Vey79p\">Snurrevin</a> has a familiar, a <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhThVWM6ZH5fbuWU2c\">rat</a></strong> named Browngnaw, that hides in the shadows near the unlit forge to the east. The duergar are preoccupied with their task and don&#x2019;t notice the party&#x2019;s entrance unless the characters make themselves known. They object violently to intruders who aren&#x2019;t escorted by duergar.<br><br>If a threat becomes apparent, the two smiths grab their weapons, use Enlarge, and move to guard the two bridges. If the fight goes against them, they turn invisible and try to slip out to area 36, then join the other duergar in area 39.<br><br>In combat, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kdl6K3Qp5OGl6Vey79p\">Snurrevin</a> might cast <em>shocking grasp</em> through his hidden familiar, and he might use <em>silent image</em> to confound enemies with realistic-seeming threats.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> In the cold forge in the northwest corner of the room, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kdl6K3Qp5OGl6Vey79p\">Snurrevin</a> has stashed 320 gp, 1,100 sp, a gold necklace set with ruby stones worth 900 gp, and a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOzZc7L1z70sUFZU5kF\">potion of hill giant strength</a></em>.<br><hr><br><h3>38. The Chasm</h3><br><blockquote>The stream running through the old dwarven bladeworks meanders through a natural cavern before tumbling into a great chasm. You can see nothing but darkness below, although the splashing of waters deep below is barely audible over the roar of the waterfall.<br><br>To the north of the chasm, a small ledge is partially hidden by a spur of rock.</blockquote> <br>The chasm is 120 feet deep. Anyone who falls in takes 42 (12d6) bludgeoning damage and ends up in area 50 of the Black Lake level. Climbing down the slippery stone next to the waterfall requires several successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks, or DC 5 checks for a character who uses a rope.<br><hr><br><h3>38a. Chain Ladder</h3>The rock spur on the northern ledge partially conceals an old chain ladder that leads down to area 51 of the Black Lake. The ladder isn&#x2019;t immediately obvious from the southern ledge, but a character who makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check can spot it.<br><hr><br><h3>39. Council Chamber</h3>The duergar have set up a guard post in what was once the council room of Khundrukar.<br><br><blockquote>The door behind the throne leads into a small audience chamber. A large table made of a single stone slab dominates the room&#x2019;s center, and old tapestries cling to the walls. A stone door in the far wall is carved with the dwarf&#x2019;s visage that you&#x2019;ve seen elsewhere.<br><br>One gray-skinned dwarf in scale mail and shield stands watch by the far door. He shouts and raises a javelin.</blockquote> <br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> Unless the party is under Ghared&#x2019;s protection (see area 36), the lone <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSE7xP7jPFqoADngq\">duergar</a></strong> on duty fights to the death to protect his leader, who is in area 40.<br><br>If the characters engage the duergar guard, the sounds of battle alert the leader, <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kdl8kFjMz0KDKC-Tefd\">Nimira</a></strong>.<br><br><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kdl8kFjMz0KDKC-Tefd\">Nimira</a> uses Enlarge and comes out to join the fight in the next round. If her guard falls or she faces at least three enemies, and negotiation isn&#x2019;t an option, she turns invisible and tries to escape into area 36 or through the secret door that leads east out of area 40.<br><br><strong><em>Negotiation.</em></strong> <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kdl8kFjMz0KDKC-Tefd\">Nimira</a> is an excellent fighter, but she is pragmatic and willing to negotiate in the right circumstances. She knows the same information as the duergar in area 36 and might be convinced to guide the party to the chasm that leads to the dragon&#x2019;s lair (area 38).<br><br><hr><br><h3>40. Durgeddin&#x2019;s Quarters</h3>Durgeddin led a spartan lifestyle, eschewing rich decorations and treasures in his personal quarters. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kdl8kFjMz0KDKC-Tefd\">Nimira</a> has appropriated the room for her own use.<br><br><blockquote>This room appears to be a bedchamber. In one corner to the south stands a large wooden sleeping platform, badly gouged by axe blows and partially burned. A table, a bench, and a writing desk have been similarly treated. In the middle of the southern wall, a space has been cleared for a simple sleeping pallet and a pair of large satchels. Two doors exit the room to the north.</blockquote><br>If the party enters the room through the secret door in the closet (see below), or if the characters avoided or quietly dealt with the guard in area 39, <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kdl8kFjMz0KDKC-Tefd\">Nimira</a> is here, resting on the pallet. Otherwise, the room is empty. The satchels contain mundane supplies: extra clothes, food, lamp oil, and similar stuff.<br><br>The door in the northwest corner leads to a bathing area, fitted with two small clay tanks to hold wash water. The northeast door opens into a closet containing the mildewed remnants of several cloaks.<br><br><strong><em>Secret Door.</em></strong> The east wall of the closet conceals a secret door. The door isn&#x2019;t well hidden, requiring a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kdl8kFjMz0KDKC-Tefd\">Nimira</a> knows about the secret passage and escapes through it if pressed.<br><br><hr><br><h3>41. Kitchens</h3><br><blockquote>The stairs leading south from the pillared hall end at a wooden door. Beyond is a corridor that opens up into a large room lined with hearths. This room must once have served as the kitchen: pots, pans, cauldrons, and kettles lie scattered on the floor and strewn across several tables. An archway to the west leads into a pantry filled with rotted foodstuffs. Suddenly, you hear a scraping sound, and a big wooden table shudders and begins to move, heading right for you!</blockquote> <br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> An <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kdh_pLyFexCZcyITIgG\">animated table</a></strong> activates when someone enters the main part of the room. It fights until destroyed but won&#x2019;t attack a dwarf. See <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdmFpk9S97e6Sdwvs8G\">Arundil&#x2019;s Animated Objects</a>.<br><br>The room is full of old, rusty iron pots, pans, cutlery, and cooking utensils, none of which are worth much.<br><br><hr><br><h3>42. Desecrated Shrine</h3>Durgeddin made his last stand in Khundrukar&#x2019;s shrine, laying enemies low until the orcs finally overwhelmed him. <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSfoDGOT0AnPY4AiF\">Orc</a> shamans pronounced dire curses over his remains to ensure that their terrible foe would never return. Then they entombed a fierce orc warrior to defend it forever in undeath.<br><br>The door leading from area 36 bears an inscription in Orc: &#x201C;Beyond this door the Maker of Death is chained. May he gnaw on his own hate until the sun dies and all things end.&#x201D;<br><br><blockquote>This room was once a shrine to the gods of the dwarves. The walls are carved with their dour images, and a low stone altar stands at the western end of the room. Stone benches have been smashed and thrown askew, and the icons of the gods have been defaced.<br><br>Atop the altar, arms folded over his chest, lies the ancient corpse of a dwarf warrior in plate armor. Bones lie heaped around the altar&#x2019;s base, and at its foot crouches the desiccated body of an orc in studded leather.</blockquote> <br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> The orc champion is now a <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhUk5u-dRX1yZpcLmK\">wight</a></strong>, an undead monster that thirsts for life essence. Two of the piles of bones are <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdlBr5DKryQT62a3tar\">ogre skeletons</a></strong>. The ogres were slain during the final battle and later animated to join the orc warrior in his watch.<br><br>The wight and skeletons lie immobile until someone enters. They can&#x2019;t pursue characters outside room.<br><br><blockquote>Some of the bones at the foot of the altar stir and form into a pair of towering skeletons clutching greatclubs. The dead orc warrior looks up at you and grins evilly, green fire burning in its hate-filled eyes as it stands.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The orcs looted the shrine after the fall of Khundrukar, but two members of the previous expedition fell to the undead defenders with valuables in their possession. Under a scattering of bones near the altar can be found a sack that holds 280 gp and a bone case that contains a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOqDRCDv27CWRrlpuMD\">spell scroll</a></em> of <em>web</em> and a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOqDRCDv27CWRrlpuMD\">spell scroll</a></em> of <em>spider </em><em>climb</em>.<br><hr><br><h3>43. Entrance to the Dwarf-Halls</h3>The dwarves of Khundrukar once resided in private rooms to the north of the great hall. When the orcs came through, they cut down all the dwarves they found and stripped the treasure out of the place.<br><br><blockquote>The door opens into a large chamber with a dark pool in the center. Bits of smashed furniture and other debris are scattered about the floor. Hallways lead off to the east and the west.<br><br>A weird moaning fills the area, slowly becoming recognizable as Dwarvish curses. The sound rises to angry shouting and grows closer. Then the translucent form of an armored dwarf appears through a wall and attacks!</blockquote> <br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> Area 43, area 46, and all the rooms marked 44 are now the demesne of the dwarf mage Arundil, who lingers as an insane <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kd2h3b6Ace8oY6c8dYg\">ghost</a></strong>.<br><br>The ghost relentlessly attacks anyone who enters its territory (most likely in either area 43 or area 46) but can&#x2019;t pursue characters who retreat beyond its domain. If the ghost is turned, it flees to one of the empty rooms labeled as area 44.<br><br><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> Arundil&#x2019;s ghost is tormented by grief and shame over abandoning his kin to die (see area 47). The spirit might be laid to rest if the characters can convince it that they have cleansed Khundrukar.<br><hr><br><h3>44. Looted Rooms</h3>Severak chambers in the Foundry were once living quarters, drawing rooms, barracks, armories, storerooms, and so on. Now they contain only smashed furniture and debris from the final battle, graffiti in the <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhSfoDGOT0AnPY4AiF\">Orc</a> language, and skeletal remains of dwarves and orcs.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Here and there a remnant of something valuable can be salvaged from the trash. Roll a d10 the first time a character searches a given room; on a result of 10, the character uncovers a semiprecious stone (see <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KeGXE81wNbdD0h7tHHI\">10 gp Gemstones</a>).<br><br><hr><br><h3>45. Skeleton Room</h3>One of the smaller chambers once served as a small barracks. Half a dozen dwarves perished here and were later animated by Arundil (see area 47). He ordered them to defend their post against all intruders.<br><br><blockquote>This chamber might once have been a barracks. The remains of six wooden bunks lean against the walls, burned and hacked by pillagers, and half a dozen skeletal dwarves lie here and there on the floor. With clicking and scraping sounds, the skeletons rise and advance on you.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creatures.</em></strong> The six <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhUMgwu12_owX5u79e\">skeletons</a> </strong>attack any non-undead creature that enters. They don&#x2019;t pursue anyone beyond this chamber.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The rogue from the failed expedition lies in this room, her desiccated corpse half-buried under wrecked furniture. A pouch on her belt contains 670 sp.<br><hr><br><h3>46. Common Area</h3>The open courtyard in the east end of the residential area was the site of a pitched battle between dwarves and orcs.<br><br><blockquote>The hallway leads to a large open chamber. Three doors open into it, and a dark pool fills a low stone basin in its center. The chamber is littered with the remains of old warriors. Seven dwarf corpses lie where they fell a hundred years ago, surrounded by the remains of at least a dozen orc warriors. The dead have been stripped of their arms and armor; only a handful of broken weapons and shattered shields remain.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> If the characters approach this area from the secret door to the south before entering area 43, Arundil the <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Kd2h3b6Ace8oY6c8dYg\">ghost</a></strong> confronts them here; refer to the encounter in area 43. Otherwise, there is nothing dangerous or valuable in the area.<br><hr><br><h3>47. Arundil&#x2019;s Chambers</h3>Arundil, the leading mage of Khundrukar and Durgeddin&#x2019;s trusted advisor, lived in a spacious room close to the great hall. During the final assault of the orcs, Arundil used his magic to escape the slaughter. He returned to find all his kinfolk dead. Driven insane with grief, he tried to repair some of the complex&#x2019;s defenses, animating dead warriors and various objects to kill any intruders that returned. In his madness, he even summoned a fiend (see area 49), and he perished at its hands not long after.<br><br><blockquote>This chamber must once have been the personal quarters of an important dwarf. It is decorated with tapestries and furnished comfortably, although age has taken its toll on the contents. Apparently, the room has not been looted. A beautiful rug covers the center of the floor, and a simple bed and writing desk stand in the southwest corner.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> The rug, 20 feet square, is actually a <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhUITsszVFLWtngRbL\">Gargantuan rug of smothering</a></strong> that activates when any non-dwarf sets foot on it. It fights until destroyed but doesn&#x2019;t attack a dwarf under any circumstances. See <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdmFpk9S97e6Sdwvs8G\">Arundil&#x2019;s Animated Objects</a>.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Beneath the bed is a small wooden chest containing 1,200 sp, 3,000 cp, and a square of silk in which are wrapped a star sapphire worth 500 gp and a pair of matched blue topazes worth 90 gp each.<br><br><hr><br><h3>48. Looted Armory</h3>Khundrukar&#x2019;s armory was looted long ago. Its door is made of iron plates, but the lock was broken during the pillaging&#x2014;it can be forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.<br><br><blockquote>Rows of empty weapon racks and a dozen or more armor stands indicate that this room was once an armory. Some debris litters the floor, but nothing of value is readily apparent.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> One of the armor stands is actually an animated object (use the <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhRUsBN68Xd7di4kY8\">animated armor</a></strong> stat block), which activates when a non-dwarf enters the room. It fights until destroyed. See <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdmFpk9S97e6Sdwvs8G\">Arundil&#x2019;s Animated Objects</a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>49. Idalla&#x2019;s Den</h3>The mad dwarf Arundil used every magical tool at his disposal to protect the complex. He not only animated objects and the bones of the dead but called upon more dangerous magic in his futile attempt to make the place safe. In the former chambers of a dwarf scholar, tucked away in the eastern end of Khundrukar, he found a scroll that he tried to use to bind a fiend to his service.<br><br><blockquote>This room was once a library or a study. Bookshelves stand against the walls. Piles of books rest on a reading table in the middle of the room. The air reeks of moldy paper. Doors exit to the north, east, and south.<br><br>A beautiful, slender woman with long black hair sits in a chair at the table, looking extreme&#xAD;ly sad. Her clothing, though well worn, does little to detract from her appearance.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> Arundil summoned a <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhUZT_mifRnR4mtfps\">succubus</a></strong> and commanded it to guard the area that is now the domain of Arundil&#x2019;s ghost (see area 43). But the fiend easily overpowered Arundil&#x2019;s will, then toyed with him cruelly until it finally drained his life force.<br><br>The succubus, which calls itself Idalla, claimed the scholar&#x2019;s library for its own and spends much time here reading through the collected lore. It learned of Khundrukar&#x2019;s history from the scholar&#x2019;s records and realized that the legends of wondrous treasure would lure greedy souls. It consumed the wizard from the previous expedition, who took refuge in this library after his companions were killed. Since that time, it has spread rumors to draw more adventurers to its lair.<br>Idalla takes the form of a human woman. When the characters enter, the fiend jumps up and begs to be released from imprisonment. Idalla tells the characters that she is a captive of a wizard who resides below this level. The succubus plays the role to the hilt, trembling and crying as it spins a tale of woe. It tries to split up the group, persuading one character to remain (using its Charm attack if necessary) while the others deal with the wizard. If they leave anyone alone with Idalla, the fiend attempts to kiss and drain the hapless dupe. The succubus is an adept liar and mixes in just enough of the truth to be convincing; see <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdmFyAft9ShEwAmWRJZ\">Idalla&#x2019;s Story</a>.<br><br>If the characters attack, Idalla attempts to charm the most dangerous-looking character and turn him or her against the party while the fiend fades into the Ethereal.<br><br><strong><em>49a (Bedchamber).</em></strong> The adjoining room was the sleeping quarters of the dwarf scholar. It is moldy and very stuffy. Anyone who looks around the room finds a secret compartment in one of the walls with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The dwarf scholar amassed a small amount of treasure, which he kept in the secret compartment: 110 gp and a cat&#x2019;s-eye gem worth 70 gp. In the library, in addition to an extensive collection of dwarven lore, the characters can find four <em>spell scrolls</em> (of <em>alarm</em>, <em>disguise self</em>, <em>enlarge/reduce</em>, and <em>shield</em>). The shelves might also include more scrolls, useful information tying in to future adventures, items of value to a collector, or other interesting lore, as you see fit.<br>"

            "gmnotes": "<h2>The Black Lake</h2>The darkest and most remote corner of the Glitterhame’s cavern system, the Black Lake is a large, winding cavern filled with water that drains from the Dark Mere through a submerged siphon. From the lake, the subterranean river flows west through the Sinkhole, across the bottom of the chasm in area 3 of the Mountain Door, and onward for about 5 miles until it emerges at the surface.<br><br>The dwarves of Khundrukar never settled these caverns, although Durgeddin had his followers begin work on an escape route through the depths.<br><br>The Black Lake is now the domain of Nightscale, a young black dragon. Here she has built her hoard, having slowly collected most of the remaining loot from Khundrukar. From the lake, Nightscale can swim to the Sinkhole, climb up to the Glitterhame, or fly up to the Foundry through the chasm there. The troglodytes fear and worship the dragon. The duergar have negotiated an uneasy truce with Nightscale, paying her a modest tribute to leave them alone.<br><br>The following locations are identified on the map in this handout.<br><hr><br><h3>50. The Cascade</h3>The stream in area 38 flows over the edge of the chasm and pours down into a turbulent pool.<br><br><blockquote>A thundering spray of water fills this chamber, pooling and flowing out to join a larger river to the north. The air is damp, and the roar of the waterfall is deafening. A broad ledge heads north toward the river and then turns out of sight to the east. The muddy bank of the pool looks disturbed by tracks of some kind.</blockquote> <br>A character who makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check identifies the tracks as those of a Large reptilian creature with four feet and a long tail. The tracks lead away from the hard stone of the ledge to the north (where they can’t be seen) and into the water.<br><br><hr><br><h3>51. Dwarven Bridges</h3>Durgeddin’s followers built two stone bridges when they started work on the escape route through this level. The chain ladder that drops from the north ledge of area 38 ends just above the ground in the area south of the western bridge.<br><br>If the characters reached this area by using the chain ladder or otherwise descending through the chasm, read or paraphrase the following text. Adjust the information as needed if they arrive here by a different route.<br><br><blockquote>A fast-moving underground river roars from east to west under a stone bridge. The bottom of the chain ladder is near the south bank of the river. On the north side of the bridge, a ledge continues to the east.</blockquote> <br>If the characters go north and cross the bridge, read:<br><br><blockquote>After a short distance, the ledge leading east bends to the south, and a second bridge surmounts the river.</blockquote><br>The western bridge is safe, but the bridge to the east is not. It has settled considerably, some of its stone blocks leaning precariously. Also, the stone has a curiously pitted appearance (which was caused by Nightscale’s acid breath). A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check can determine that the stone was affected by acid, although the source of the acid isn’t apparent.<br><br><strong><em>Hazard.</em></strong> The weakened bridge can’t take much weight before it collapses. If more than one Small or larger creature is on the bridge at one time, or if a character in heavy armor steps onto it, the arch fails. Any creature on the span must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to catch itself on the ledge. On a failed save, a creature falls, takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from falling timbers and stones, and is caught in the river’s current (see <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdmAHvz_Si-FDZcP1Nr\">Fast-Flowing Water</a>).<br><hr><br><h3>52. Nightscale’s Lair</h3>When the characters first approach the southeastern shore of the lake, Nightscale is dozing on her hoard on the island (area 53). The dragon is immediately alerted to their presence if the characters make noise, carry light sources, or trigger the collapse of the bridge. Otherwise, the characters don’t draw the dragon’s attention unless they move all the way to the ledge directly south of area 53.<br><br><blockquote>The dilapidated bridge leads to another ledge that winds southeast alongside a very large lake, apparently the source of the underground river. The cavern is quite large; the lake’s far shore is lost in shadow, and the echoes of water seem to indicate a very sizable cave.</blockquote><br><strong><em>Creature.</em></strong> When Nightscale becomes aware of intruders, the <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-KdhUnjZ6bNf6D_175Fs\">young black dragon</a></strong> slips into the water, quietly swimming to a point near the three stepping stones shown on the map. Any character watching the lake can make a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the dragon’s Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a successful check, the character catches a glimpse of a serpentine form moving in the darkness.<br><br>When the characters first see Nightscale, reveal <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kdp61rbRp0QGGnnL0sf\">Handout: Area 52</a>.<br><br>The dragon takes full advantage of her aquatic environment and never offers an easy target to enemies. She begins combat at a range of 20 to 30 feet, raising only her head and part of her neck above the water (granting her three-quarters cover) and breathing acid. Then she submerges and waits for her breath weapon to recharge. Nightscale doesn’t resort to melee combat unless she is confronted underwater. If the dragon is reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, she tries to escape through the passage in area 54.<br><br><strong><em>Negotiation.</em></strong> Nightscale isn’t inclined to parley with the characters unless they surrender, give her all of their treasure, and throw their arms and armor in the lake. If the characters seriously injure her, Nightscale might bargain to buy time so she can later move her hoard. Only when she is near death does she abandon her treasure.<br><hr><br><h3>53. Nightscale’s Hoard</h3>When the characters come into view of the island for the first time, read:<br><br><blockquote>A short distance offshore sits a small isle thirty or forty feet across. Stalagmites thrust up at the ceiling above, and the dark waters lap quietly at its shores. Several spots on its surface glimmer even in the gloom, suggesting the promise of treasure to be had.</blockquote> <br>Nightscale keeps her treasure on the small island in the lake, and she spends most of her time resting here. If the characters have avoided attracting her attention so far and want to approach the island, they can do so quietly if every character’s Dexterity (Stealth) check meets or exceeds the dragon’s passive Perception score.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Nightscale has accumulated considerable wealth from her plunder of Khundrukar. Her hoard contains 6,200 sp, 1,430 gp, two garnets worth 20 gp each, a black pearl worth 50 gp, a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdhbYvza7TbllWrDBgf\">wand of magic missiles</a></em>, a <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOrjtXOy85Exs_hCiMd\"><em>+2 greataxe</em></a> bearing Durgeddin’s smith-mark, a <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdhbgPechW4hWrrQoBZ\"><em>+1 shield</em></a>, a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KOuZOZ8F6tpvRDI-Ioo\">potion of healing</a></em>, and a <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Kd2xgSWR-3UCCOympg9\">potion of flying</a></em>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>54. The Dragon’s Passage</h3>Beneath the surface of a small pool is an underwater passage that links the Black Lake to the Dark Mere on the east side of the Stone Tooth. The submerged passage is about 700 feet long.<br>"

Townsfolk hail them on the street, and some might approach them with problems that can lead to further adventures. The characters can continue to use the town as a base of operations. Other developments depend on what got them here and how they leave.<br><br><h4>Follow the Map</h4>While the characters are exploring the stronghold, they might find another map, perhaps on the body of an adventurer from the previous expedition, or in the library in area 49. It could lead to a different dungeon, a city in some land far away, or an as-yet-unknown location rumored to hide a fabulous treasure.<br><br><h4>Track the Broken Blade</h4>If the characters were sent to retrieve weapons for Baron Althon, they can bring him the <em>+1 lo</em><em>ngsword</em> from area 22, the <em>+2 greataxe</em> in area 53, the handaxe from area 14, and the warhammer from area 23. All bear Durgeddin&#x2019;s smith-mark; Baron Althon pays 500 gp above the market price for each mundane weapon, 1,000 gp for the <em>+1 longsword</em>, and 6,000 gp for the <em>+2 greataxe</em>, if the characters are willing to sell.<br><br><h4>Vanquish the Orc Raiders</h4>The characters can return to <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-KdlPOsOzTK6hQ1zC0vz\">Blasingdell</a> at any time to collect the bounty for orcs they kill or capture. If the characters eliminate all the orcs in the stronghold, the mayor honors them with a celebration attended by the eminent citizens of the town. The characters have established valuable contacts who can aid them in their later endeavors.<br><br><h3>Further Adventures</h3><hr>You can build an entire campaign around the duergar that occupy the Foundry. Perhaps they came here from a hidden city in even deeper caverns beneath the Sinkhole and the Black Lake. Your answers to the following questions form the basis for further adventures:<br><br><ul><li>How did the duergar get into the complex?</li><li>What is the mysterious project they are working on?</li><li>Did Durgeddin know of the duergar&#x2019;s existence?</li><li>Do the duergar have some of Durgeddin&#x2019;s items? If so, are they guarding them or using them?</li></ul><br>You can also use this adventure to sow the seeds of the characters&#x2019; next activity. Perhaps the party encounters a legend of a magical treasure from Khundrukar&#x2019;s fall, buried in the tomb of an evil knight. Maybe Great Ulfe&#x2019;s ogre clan is terrorizing a nearby area, or an orc war chief wields a legendary weapon that was crafted by Durgeddin.<br><br>Whatever form they take, the repercussions of the characters&#x2019; descent into Khundrukar have the potential to affect their lives for years to come.<br>"

It’s also a great starting experience for someone looking to be a Dungeon Master for the first time. <br><hr><br><h3>The Forge of Fury</h3><em>The Forge of Fury</em>, written by Richard Baker, was published in 2000 shortly after <em>The Sunless Citadel</em>. Characters who succeeded in that mission and advanced to 3rd level were now ready to take on the challenges of a ruined dwarven fortress.<br><br>Like its predecessor, <em>The Forge of Fury</em> is tailored to provide increasingly tougher threats as the characters make their way through the fortress.

Leason, made its debut under the title <em>Lost Tamoachan</em> at the Origins game convention in 1979, where it was used in the official D&amp;D competition.

In its original form, it was used as the story of the D&amp;D Encounters season in the spring of 2014. Featuring an immense and lethal dungeon known as the Doomvault, the adventure serves as a tribute to <em>Tomb of Horrors</em>, <em>Ruins of Undermountain</em>, and other “killer dungeons” throughout the history of the game.<br><br>The version of <em>Dead in Thay</em> presented here is modified for use in home campaigns. It is designed for characters of 9th to 11th level.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Against the Giants</h3>The three linked adventures that make up <em>Against the Giants</em> were created and originally released in 1978, during the time when Gary Gygax was still writing the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> for the original AD&amp;D game. Despite being (in a sense) older than the game itself, these adventures continue to hold a special place in the hearts and memories of D&amp;D players of all ages.<br><br>The compilation of <em>Steading of the Hill Giant Chief</em>, <em>Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl</em>, and <em>Hall of the Fire Giant King</em> was published in 1981 as <em>Against the Giants</em>. The version presented here is designed to be undertaken by characters of 11th level.<br><hr><br><h3>Tomb of Horrors</h3>Before there was much of anything else in the world of the D&amp;D game, there was the Tomb of Horrors.<br><br>The first version of the adventure was crafted for Gary Gygax’s personal campaign in the early 1970s and went on to be featured as the official Dungeons &amp; Dragons event at the original Origins gaming convention in 1975. The first publication of <em>Tomb of Horrors</em>, as a part of the Advanced D&amp;D game, came in 1978.<br><br>As a proving ground for characters and players alike, fabricated by the devious mind of the game’s cocreator, <em>Tomb of Horrors</em> has no equal in the annals of D&amp;D’s greatest adventures. Only high-level characters stand a chance of coming back alive, but every player who braves the Tomb will have the experience of a lifetime."

Creatures have disadvantage on any ability check that relies on hearing.<br><br>\nMost of the plane’s inhabitants are creatures that were banished to the plane with no hope of escape, and many of them have been driven mad by the incessant winds or forced to take shelter in places where the winds die down until they sound like distant cries of torment. The information above is available to the adventurers if they succeed at a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Two or more of them may confer to grant one of them Advantage on this check.<hr><h3>Mad Winds</h3>\nA visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw after each hour spent among the howling winds*. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. A creature that reaches six levels of exhaustion while on this plane doesn’t die. Instead, the creature gains a random form of <strong>indefinite madness</strong>, as described here.

            "gmnotes": "<h3>Area 1. Temple Foyer</h3>\n<h4>Dimensions &amp; Terrain</h4>\nRoughly thirty-five feet by thirty-five feet, this chamber, like all of those throughout the temple, appears to have been rough-cut from the porous rock that makes up this place. The stone walls allow the wind free reign here in the temple, and have littered the floor with sand, pebbles, and stones that kick up as the adventurers walk across them.<br><br>\n<h4>Traps &amp; Puzzles</h4>\nThere was a high-level <a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Glyph%20of%20Warding#h-Glyph%20of%20Warding\"><em>glyph of warding</em></a> in this chamber. However, when the mind flayers attempted to pass from this chamber, they triggered the trap which summoned an invisible stalker. They managed to slay the creature, but not before it took one of them down.<br><br>\nOn the floor of this chamber is a dead mind flayer. Its insides are filled with sand and pebbles. <em>Detect magic</em> reveals residual magic using both abjuration and conjuration schools. If the characters possess this knowledge, a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana or Investigation) check allows them to ascertain that either “the wind” rose up and killed the illithid, or an air elemental or something similar was responsible.<hr>\n<h3>Area 2. Cloak Room</h3>\n<h4>Dimensions &amp; Terrain</h4>\nFifty feet on a side, the walls of this rough-cut room have been scoured clean and smell strongly of chlorine. Stone benches have been carved directly from the stone by the chaos priests that once lived here, though constant exposure to the winds of the plane have left them structurally brittle.<br><br>\nSeveral aged and rotted garments lay scattered across the floor, discarded by chaos clergy in favor of more ecclesiastical clothing before moving further into the temple complex. The walls here were washed with a chlorine solution daily when the temple was in use, thus giving the entire chamber its unusual odor.<br><br>\nThere is nothing else of apparent interest here, though if the adventurers make a successful DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check, they find a mithral brooch adorned with gold tracery, embedded in the wall in one corner of the room. This was overlooked by the mind flayers.<br><br>\n<h4>Treasure &amp; Rewards</h4>\nThe characters may find the following treasure.<br><br>A <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-LC12uW0NIbGc2YjWrTy\">brooch of shielding</a></em>; a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that it was crafted by a celestial artisan.<hr><h3>Area 3. Guard Station</h3><h4>Dimensions &amp; Terrain</h4>\nThis elongated chamber (fifty-five feet by eighty-five feet) has a twenty-foot high ceiling. The room may have once served as a guard station as hooks and racks for weapons are arrayed throughout the room. The few weapons that remain resemble the glaive, though the blades are pitted, scored, and brittle. The wood that makes up their hafts is all but rotted away. About a dozen of the aged polearms hang from the walls haphazardly about the room.<br><br>\n<h4>Creatures/NPCs</h4>\nThere is an<strong> <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-LC100i0NBvVkMryP84x\">elder oblex</a> </strong>in this chamber, though the bulk of the creature resides as a strange pool of red goo on the far side of the chamber from where the adventures must enter.<br><br>\nAs the gith approach the chamber, the oblex sends a sulfurous impersonation of a human woman dressed in plate mail and bearing a longsword, to the entrance to beckon the adventurers forward into the chamber.<br><br>\nAs the adventurers approach the chamber, the human woman backs away from them as it continues to beckon them into the room. Being quite intelligent, the oblex can absolutely hold a conversation with the gith using this form.<br><br><h4>Objectives/Goals</h4>The elder oblex is a creation of the mind flayers and brought here to guard the way in. Its primary goal is to keep the adventurers from proceeding any further into the temple.<br><br><h4>What do they know?</h4>As the oblex is incredibly intelligent, it completely understands and supports the mind flayers’ objectives in their mission to subjugate the gith.<br><br><h4>Playing the Pillars</h4><strong>Combat:</strong> If the duergar from the other side of the portal are pursuing the adventurers, the elder oblex uses Sulfurous Impersonation to try and lure them in quickly with promises of aid. Since the characters won’t be able to hear the creature due to the winds, its communication consists of gestures only.<br><br><strong>Exploration: </strong>The first thing the adventurers notice about the chamber this creature inhabits is that it smells strongly of sulphur. Also, the floor of this chamber is strangely clear of sand and debris.<br><br><strong>\nSocial: </strong>If the gith wish to speak with the elder oblex, it is happy to waste their time with idle conversation. It tells them all manner of seemingly useful things that aren’t true.<hr><h3>Area 4. Purification Chamber</h3><h4>Dimensions &amp; Terrain</h4>\nDirectly conjoined to the hallway, this chamber is twenty-five feet wide by forty-feet long. Sand mixed with crumbly pumice dances in the wind upon the floor here.<br><br>\n<h4>Other Features</h4>\nA large vat of bubbling wax that is kept constantly hot by a magic flame beneath it, is on the far side of the chamber from the hallway. The vat is constructed of porcelain and inlaid with silver tracery around the edges.<br><br>\nLong strips of ragged and aged cloth hang from a pair of steel bars over the vat, where they are tied on to keep them from blowing away in the wind.<br><br>\nA sizeable collection of pumice stones, some of them covered with dried brown flecks, rest within large metal bowls next to the porcelain vat.<br><br>\nThis was a purification chamber. Priests would strip naked and use the wax and cloth strips to remove all hair from their bodies before scrubbing themselves vigorously (sometimes to the point of bleeding) with the pumice stones. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check confirms that the 'dry brown flecks' are blood.<hr><h3>Area 5. High Priest's Quarters</h3><br><h4>Dimensions &amp; Terrain</h4>This side chamber is twenty-five feet by thirty feet. Pebbles and sand shift and spin here as the wind changes.<br><br>\n<h4>Other Features</h4>\nA long iron bar is suspended between and imbedded into the walls here, about seven feet up from the floor. A few ragged leather straps hang loosely from the bar.<br><br>\nAn iron chest of drawers is embedded in the far wall. The chest of drawers is not locked, nor is it trapped. Inside the chest of drawers are several items useful to a priest. A corroded silver aspergillum that looks like a strange horned skull with small rubies for eyes, 2 glass vials of holy water, incense that smells strangely of chlorine, and a vial of acid.<br><br>\nThe acid and holy water are unlabeled and look the same to the untrained eye. Kalak, who is proficient with alchemy supplies, can readily tell the difference given 10 minutes and use of his supplies (no check required).<br>\n<br>The high priest used to hang from the bar by leather straps. There he'd sleep as the winds of Pandemonium raged throughout his chamber. He was quite insane, as were all the clergy of this temple, before it collapsed into decay and ruin.<br><br>\n<h4>Treasure &amp; Rewards</h4>\nThe characters find the following treasure.<br><br><ul><li>Silver aspergillum (500 gp)</li><li>Two vials of holy water</li><li>One vial of acid</li></ul><hr><h3>Area 6. Observation Point</h3><h4>Dimensions &amp; Terrain</h4>\nA wrought iron spiral staircase, rusted and crumbling from disrepair and neglect, leads up to the ceiling of this circular chamber, twenty-five feet in diameter.<br><br>It appears that there may have once been a tower, or at the very least, another chamber above this room, but stone is all that remains where a doorway should be. The ceiling of this chamber is solid stone and not porous like the walls and ceilings throughout the rest of the complex.<br><br>\n<h4>Other Features</h4>\nThis passage indeed leads to another chamber of approximately the same size as this one. The chamber above is completely sealed off from the winds of Pandemonium, though it has a small two-foot by two-foot window that has been fitted with an adamantine shutter. The shutter may be opened or closed from inside so that the high priest could look out upon Pandemonium and meditate.<br><br>\nIf the characters open the shutter, feel free to describe the most hellish, wind-blasted landscape you can. Closing and sealing the shutter requires either a Strength of 18 or a successful DC 15 Strength check.<br><br>\nThe high priest of the temple was the only one to come up here, and he entered the room using a <a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Stone%20Shape#h-Stone%20Shape\"><em>stone shape</em></a> spell. If the characters can enter the chamber, it makes an excellent place to rest or hide, whatever the case may be. While the staircase is in disrepair, it is sturdy enough for an individual gith to traverse at a time.<hr><h3>Area 7. Clergy Quarters</h3><h4>Dimensions &amp; Terrain</h4>This chamber is thirty feet by fifty feet. A viscous fluid comprised of water mixed with grainy sand and earth, drips from the ceiling coating the floors and walls.<br><br>\n<h4>Other Features</h4>\nThough it is not marked on the map this room has a thick stone door (AC 17, hp 30), located at the far end of the hall just before entering the room itself. The door was accidentally shut when the star spawn manglers entered the chamber. It is locked and requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check made by someone proficient with thieves’ tools to unlock it, or a successful DC 20 Strength check made by someone with a Strength score of 16 or greater, to break it down.<br>\n<br>Opening the door to this chamber reveals a grisly sight. Three desiccated human corpses are strung up at even intervals on iron bars that cross the room in a grid, eight feet above the ground. The bodies hang lifelessly from leather straps that are tied down to the grid with elaborate knots.<br><br>\nThe floors here are slick because of the water and walking on them is normally no trouble. However, once combat begins, anyone charging across the floor must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or slip and fall prone. The viscous fluid coats their hands, imposing disadvantage on their next weapon attack roll. This fluid can be removed by using an action to scrape off the character's hands.<br><br>\n<h4>Creatures/NPCs</h4>\nThree<strong> </strong><strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-LC142QJdqt9o6Cb0DER\">star spawn manglers</a></strong> were the first creatures to emerge from the portal to the Far Realm when the mind flayers opened it. These shadowy low-slung, creeping horrors each have six arms, and move quickly along the ground and walls.<br><br><h4>Objectives/Goals</h4>\nThese creatures immediately fled the chamber with the illithids and started exploring the complex, until they became trapped here. Natural assassins, when the adventurers start fiddling with the door, they quickly find hiding places in the shadows and attempt to ambush the interlopers.<br><br>\n<h4>What do they know?</h4>\nThese creatures were commanded by a star spawn seer to investigate the complex beyond the portal and make certain the ritual to charge the <em>Gith Capacitor</em> was not interrupted.<br><br>\n<h4>Playing the Pillars</h4><strong>Combat: </strong>The star spawn manglers take advantage of their shadowy surroundings to get the drop on the adventurers and continue to hide in the shadows throughout combat.<br><br><strong>Exploration: </strong>The water is not drinkable and attempting to do so requires the unwise to succeed at a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or suffer from the <em>poisoned</em> condition for the next 24 hours.<br><br><strong>Social: </strong>The star spawn manglers are certainly prone to taunting chatter during combat, and share a language in common with <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-LC0qUsbEGvfnvz4a3w5\">Ven'delen</a>, the bard. If conversation transpires, it is certainly possible for the adventurers to learn that the illithid made a deal with a powerful <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-LC0yRvcf4SKPOGFsvlx\">star spawn seer</a> in the Far Realm, and that they may want to get a move on, as the artifact has already begun charging.<hr><h3>Area 8. Statuary Chamber</h3><h4>Dimensions &amp; Terrain</h4>\nThis oddly circular chamber is forty feet in diameter one way and fifty feet in diameter the other.<br><br>\n<h4>Other Features</h4>\nStatues, carved from a pure white marble, struck through with veins of a strange blood-red stone, stand at the perimeter of this chamber. A massive humanoid figure, also carved from the strange marble, stands the center of the chamber, its arms held high above its head to support the ceiling, forty feet above. A pair of fist-sized black crystals is fitted to the statue’s eyes.<br><br>\nThe perimeter statues, six in all, appear to resemble naked humans in various states of torture. Feel free to make up descriptions of what this could be, or simply leave it to the imagination of your players. Either way, some degree of discretion and sensitivity to the age and experience of your audience should be liberally exercised.<br><br>\n<h4>Creatures/NPCs</h4>\nAn<strong> <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-LC0yrLn_lVmx-FYkvH-\">eidolon</a> </strong>of the former high priest of this temple resides within the central <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-LC0ynp_8MU62yc4m-wH\">sacred statue</a></strong> of this chamber. The statue depicts some forgotten god dedicated to chaos and entropy, and as described below, holds up the ceiling overhead.<br><br>\n<h4>Objectives/Goals</h4>\nAware of the creature’s existence, the mind flayers were able to make a pact with it and are bound to return with many sacrifices once they have completed their business in the Far Realm.<br>\n<br>Interested in being worshipped once more, the insane eidolon protects this chamber from passage by creatures that aren’t mind flayers or star spawn.<br><br>\n<h4>What do they know?</h4>\nThe eidolon is aware of the illithids’ goal and is most ready and willing to do its part, as the result means blood on the altar to its dark and forgotten deity.<br><br>\n<h4>Playing the Pillars</h4><strong>Combat: </strong>When combat begins, the eidolon animates the sacred statue in the center of the chamber and attacks the adventurers. This allows the ceiling to slowly descend, clicking loudly.<br><br>\nIf the sacred statue is destroyed the two black crystals explode, releasing two <strong><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-LC0yg9BXIfq2QQCfptS\">allips</a></strong>, as the eidolon is itself released from the statue.<br><br><strong>Exploration: </strong>If the adventurers investigate they notice the tops of the statues are oddly flattened, as they were built to have a descending ceiling rest upon them.<br><br><strong>Social: </strong>Once released from the statue, the eidolon begins a tirade of insults and threats. If the characters engage the creature in conversation while fighting the allips they can learn of the deal the creature made with the mind flayers, a subject that it gleefully engages in.<br><br>\nAs a note, after a minute, the ceiling rests upon the smaller statues, having descended 20 feet to do so.<hr><h3>Area 9. Torture Chamber</h3><h4>Dimensions &amp; Terrain</h4>\nThirty feet by forty feet, there is an enclosure on one end of the chamber with a broken down, rusty gate.<br><br>\n<h4>Other Features</h4>\nThe floor of this chamber is lined with small depressions at regular intervals. Water rapidly and continuously drips from the ceiling into the center of each depression. Manacled chains bound to the floor are mounted near many of the depressions.<br>\n<br>If any of the characters succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check, they determine that victims were originally bound in chains in such a manner that the water dripping from the ceiling would strike them repeatedly and unavoidably in the head. At first, this may seem innocent, but left for days, or even just hours for some, this form of torture could break even the most steadfast soul or drive them completely insane.<br><br>\nA successful DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check turns up a rather sizeable black pearl (pearl of power) that seems to have found its way to the bottom of one of the depressions.<br><br>\n<h4>Treasure &amp; Rewards</h4>\nThe characters may find the following treasure.<br><br><ul><li>A<em> <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-LC13V4Ju-iCQBOihXoz\">pearl of power</a></em></li></ul><hr><h3>Area 10. Library</h3><h4>Dimensions &amp; Terrain</h4>\nSixty-five feet at its furthest distance across, and about forty feet wide, this strangely shaped chamber is mostly rectangular.<br><br>\n<h4>Other Features</h4>\nThe walls of this odd chamber appear to have, at one time, been smoothed out and finished, allowing whoever inhabited this structure to record large amounts of information in some strange language upon the walls. However, time and the winds of Pandemonium have taken their toll upon this room as with the others, and the walls are now pockmarked and eroded to the point of incoherence.<br><br>\nOriginally, the priests of this temple marked the tenants of their faith upon these walls, but the writing has been virtually scoured from the walls. Only vague markings in certain places here and there give testimony that the record even existed to begin with. Even a <em>comprehend languages</em> spell turns up gibberish from what is left.<br><br>\nThe adventurers can spend as much time as they like attempting to decipher the vague scrawl remaining, but it only wastes time. Feel free to make up bits of mad ramblings if you would like to encourage them further.<hr><h3>Area 11. The Cathedral</h3><h4>Dimensions &amp; Terrain</h4>\nForty-five feet by one-hundred-ten feet, this is a massive cathedral.<br><br>\n<h4>Lighting</h4>\nUnlike the rest of this complex, there is a dim light throughout this chamber, originating from the active portal.<br><br>\n<h4>Other Features</h4>\nThis cathedral must have been something to behold at one point in time, but now the porous stone and winds of Pandemonium have brought it to its current decrepit state. At the far end of the cathedral is a shining adamantine archway alight with runes of power. The gate to the Far Realm is open. Due to some strange influence of the Far Realm, the winds of Pandemonium do not touch this place at the moment.<br><br>\n<h4>Creatures/NPCs</h4>\nTwo<strong> <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-LC0yYteHrmjDTtUgS9E\">mind flayers</a> </strong>stand guard at the open portal to the Far Realm, though they are levitating twenty feet above the ground.<br><br>\n<h4>Objectives/Goals</h4>\nThese creatures will fight to the death to keep the gith from entering the Far Realm and attempting to spoil the plan.<br><br>\n<h4>What do they know?</h4>\nThe mind flayers know all the plans, but they’re not really in a talking mood.<br><br>\n<h4>Treasure &amp; Rewards</h4>\nA hidden<em> <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-LC1394EkGRs8o9nLAim\">eversmoking bottle</a> </em>(see <strong>Exploration</strong>).<br><br>\n<h4>Playing the Pillars</h4><strong>Combat: </strong>In combat the mind flayers start by using Mind Blast on the party simultaneously, attempting to catch as many of them in their respective attacks as possible, and thus force multiple saving throws. They both follow up with <a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Dominate%20Monster#h-Dominate%20Monster\"><em>dominate monster</em></a><em>.<br><strong></strong></em><strong><br>Exploration: </strong>While it would take considerable time to investigate every nook and cranny of this massive chamber, if <a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Detect%20Magic#h-Detect%20Magic\"><em>detect magic</em></a> is cast, the caster locates an <em><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-LC1394EkGRs8o9nLAim\">eversmoking bottle</a></em> with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check.<br><br><strong>Social: </strong>While the mind flayers aren’t normally talkative, if one or both are charmed, they know of the creatures to be faced in the Far Realm and can inform the gith as to the resistances and immunities of <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-LC0yRvcf4SKPOGFsvlx\"><strong>star spawn seer</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-LC0yVfbKBSOpoQp-WQS\"><strong>star spawn hulk</strong></a>.<br>"

In fact, the world can be anything that the DM and players can imagine. It could be a swords-and-sorcery setting at the dawn of civilization, where barbarians battle evil sorcerers, or a post-apocalyptic fantasy where elves and dwarves wield magic amid the wreckage of a technological civilization. Most D&amp;D settings are somewhere between those two extremes: worlds of medieval high fantasy with knights and castles, as well as elven cities, dwarven mines, and fearsome monsters.</span></p><p style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">The world of the Forgotten Realms is one such setting, and that’s where the story in this adventure takes place. In the Realms, knights dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur’s Gate. Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, questing against the terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving into secrets too dark for the light of day. Dragons, giants, demons, and unimaginable abominations lurk in dungeons, caverns, ruined cities, and the vast wild places of the world.</span><br></p><p style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers, sailors, and steel-hearted adventurers carrying tales of strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world. Thousands of restless would-be heroes from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages arrive in Neverwinter and the other great cities every year in search of wealth and renown.</span><br></p><p style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">Known roads may be well traveled, but they aren’t necessarily safe. Fell magic, deadly monsters, and cruel local rulers are all perils that you face when you travel in the Forgotten Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day’s walk of a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.</span><br></p><p style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">The regional map shows just a tiny part of this vast world, in a region called the Sword Coast. This is a region of adventure, where daring souls delve into the wreckage of ancient strongholds and explore ruins of long-lost cultures. Amid a wilderness of jagged, snow-capped peaks, alpine forests, lawlessness, and monsters, the coast holds the greatest bastions of civilization, including the coastal city of Neverwinter.</span><br></p></h3>",

She and the Uttolot bandits she commands have domesticated the giant ice frogs that make the cave their home, using them as guard animals.</p><hr><h4>Giant Ice Frogs</h4><p>With the exception of Old Croaker (see area C5), <b><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Lz493Fh5z3A2XZcQBqg\">giant ice frogs</a></b> are giant frogs with immunity to cold damage.</p><p>The blue-skinned frogs attack any creatures in the cave complex not escorted by bandits<b>&nbsp;</b>they recognize. Each fights until reduced to half its hit points or fewer, then flees. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check as an action convinces one frog to not attack or to stop attacking. If the character or any of their allies attacks or harms the frog, it resumes combat.</p><p>The frogs spend much of their time resting in pools of murky, frigid water in Croaker Cave. A character who succeeds on a Wisdom (Perception) check opposed by a frog’s Dexterity (Stealth) check notices a frog hiding in a pool. If a frog goes undetected, it attacks with surprise when a character comes within 5 feet of the pool.</p><hr><h4>Uttolot Bandits</h4><p>The bandits sent out with Hulil by the Uttolot family are all <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Lz8Nt-jIKyctlgDVrUv\"><b>dwarves</b></a> and <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Lz8OHZWR139K9S1yfkP\"><b>elves</b></a>. Up to ten bandits<b>&nbsp;</b>normally occupy Croaker Cave, but only three are currently present (in area C2).&nbsp;</p><p>Uttolot bandits attack any intruders on sight. Each fights until reduced to half its hit points or fewer, then flees the caves. If the characters capture an Uttolot bandit, they can learn the following information with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check:</p><ul><li>Hulil is sick with the same malady that killed Urgon Wenth.</li><li>She plans on setting out for <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Lz3ZTZNCnX_le67CBfn\">Shadycreek Run</a> soon, hoping that trading the items her sister Tulgi stole from Pelc’s Curiosities allows her to pay for healing that will cure her.</li></ul><hr><h4>Croaker Cave Features</h4><p>The caverns and tunnels of the Croaker Cave complex are shown on map 5.9. Unless otherwise noted in an area’s description, the following features are common throughout all areas of Croaker Cave.</p><p><b><i>Ceilings.</i></b> Cavern ceilings are 10 feet high, with only 8 feet of clearance beneath stalactites.</p><p><b><i>Walls. </i></b>Climbing the rough walls of a cavern requires a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p><b><i>Light. </i></b>The caverns contain no light sources, except in area C6, as the inhabitants of Croaker Cave rely on darkvision to see.</p><p><b><i>Frigid Pools.</i></b> Pools of murky, frigid water within the caverns are created by melting snow on the rocky ground above dripping down through the ceiling. Each pool is 10 feet deep. A creature completely submerged in a pool must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on this saving throw. For each minute the creature spends submerged in a pool, it must repeat this saving throw, gaining another level of exhaustion on a failure.</p><hr><h4>C1. Entrance Pool</h4><p>This area of the cave is close enough to the entrance that it is dimly lit by day and on clear moonlit nights. When the characters can see into this area, read:</p><blockquote><p>The slow dripping of water sounds out where it falls from stalactites down into a murky pool that fills the rough tunnel ahead. Every few moments, a loud croaking sounds out from somewhere in the darkness beyond.</p></blockquote><p>With darkvision or an appropriate light source, the characters can see a 25-foot-long heavy wooden beam lying against the west wall of the cave at the south end the pool. The Uttolot bandits use the beam to cross the pool, and pull it back to the far side when they are in the cave.</p><p>Two <b><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Lz493Fh5z3A2XZcQBqg\">giant ice frogs</a></b> hide in the murky pool. If combat breaks out in this area, the bandits in area C2 quickly come to investigate.</p><hr><h4>C2. Training Pool</h4><blockquote><p>The slow dripping of water from the ceiling flows to a pool in the southwest corner of this cavern. A large wooden bucket with a lid sits near the edge of the pool.</p></blockquote><p>Three Uttolot bandits (one&nbsp;<a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Lz8Nt-jIKyctlgDVrUv\" style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 ) ; color: rgb( 35 , 82 , 124 ) ; outline: 0px\"><b>dwarf</b></a>&nbsp;and two <b><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Lz8OHZWR139K9S1yfkP\">elves</a></b>)<b>&nbsp;</b>and two <b><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Lz493Fh5z3A2XZcQBqg\">giant ice frogs</a></b> normally occupy this cavern. If the bandits have not yet been alerted to disturbances, they are training the frogs. Add the following:</p><blockquote><p>A dwarf and two elves bundled in layers of winter clothing are throwing dead bats into the air. Two giant blue-skinned frogs leap up to snatch the bats in midair, seemingly as part of some sort of training session.</p></blockquote><p>If the bandits went to investigate disturbances in adjacent areas, the frogs are hiding in the pool.</p><p><b><i>Bucket.</i></b> The bucket holds six dead bats used as training treats. A character who offers a dead bat to a frog has advantage on their next Wisdom (Animal Handling) check made to control that frog’s behavior.</p><hr><h4>C3. Bat Cavern</h4><blockquote><p>&nbsp;This cavern reeks, and its floor is covered in bat guano.</p></blockquote><p>A <b><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Lz45BpD9b0rkaatbn9E\">swarm of bats</a></b> sleeps among the stalactites in this cavern. If anything disturbs the bats (including a light source or a loud noise in the cavern), the swarm attacks the source of the disturbance. The swarm fights until reduced to half its hit points or fewer, then flees out of the cave complex. If combat breaks out in this area, the bandits in area C2 come to investigate.</p><p><b><i>Treacherous Floor.</i></b> The floor of this area is covered in slippery bat guano. Whenever a creature standing on the floor takes damage, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone.</p><hr><h4>C4. Bandit Camp</h4><blockquote><p>Ten empty bedrolls are arranged in a circle around a cold fire pit at the center of this cavern. Chicken bones, empty wine and spirits bottles, and other food waste litters the floor.</p></blockquote><p>One of the bedrolls covers the opening of a 10-foot-deep pit trap. The trap can be spotted with a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. If not spotted, anyone walking across the bedroll falls into the pit, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone. A creature that falls into the pit makes enough noise that the bandits in area C2 investigate.</p><p><b><i>Treasure.</i></b> Searching all the bedrolls reveals that one contains an unopened bottle of <b>Bald Dwarf Whisky</b> (worth 25 gp), an alcohol made by elves in Uthodurn.</p><hr><h4>C5. Old Croaker’s Pool</h4><blockquote><p>Water dripping down from stalactites in the ceiling fills a dark pool that completely covers the floor of this cavern.</p></blockquote><p>Croaker Cave’s largest denizen—named Old Croaker by the Uttolot bandits—has claimed this pool. It hides in the water and attacks as other giant ice frogs.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Lz480Cz-gglePeq5byb\" style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\"><b>Old Croaker</b></a>&nbsp;is a giant toad with immunity to cold damage.</p><p>Old Croaker has been trained to ferry Hulil and visitors to her cavern (area C6) across the pool. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to convince Old Croaker to not attack the party can also convince the frog to ferry all the characters across the pool one at a time.</p><hr><h4>C6. Hulil’s Cavern</h4><p>When the characters can see into this area, read:</p><blockquote><p>A warm rush of heat comes from a massive fire burning in the center of this cavern, its smoke venting up through a narrow stone chimney. The flames illuminate a rough painting of a five-headed dragon that dominates the north wall. A bedroll is spread out beneath the mural. Near the crackling blaze, a dwarf bundled in a heavy cloak sits on a stone chest beside an elf whose face is covered in dragon tattoos. The dwarf’s face is streaked with pulsing blue veins.</p></blockquote><p><b><a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Lz8T190l-0zNBVYtWSd\">Hulil Lutan</a></b>&nbsp;(a neutral evil, female mountain dwarf cult fanatic with a walking speed of 15 feet, darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against poison) and her apprentice,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/character/-Lz8Y8U3SRRzhp-7vili\" style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\"><b>Raegrin Mau</b></a>&nbsp;(a neutral evil, male wood elf cultist<b>&nbsp;</b>with darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and immunity to magic that would put him to sleep), are both in a state of deep meditation, praying to <span style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\">Tiamat</span>&nbsp;for a cure for the dwarf’s affliction. Even if combat broke out in area C5, they remain unaware of the characters’ presence until they are disturbed or attacked. Hulil and Raegrin are both greedy servants of Tiamat and the Uttolot family. Raegrin follows Hulil’s every order with unshaking loyalty.</p><p>Hulil is so desperate for a cure for the ailment that is slowly killing her that she doesn’t attack the characters when she first sees them, as long as she isn’t attacked first. Instead, she orders them to stand down and demands to know why they came to the cave. A quick-thinking character can claim to have come to help Hulil (at the direction of her sister, after receiving a message from Tiamat, or with another appropriate rationale). With a successful Charisma (Deception) check opposed by Hulil’s Wisdom (Insight) check, the character convinces the dwarf that all the characters are her allies. On a failed check, or if the characters challenge her, Hulil and Raegrin attack.</p><p><b><i>Campfire. </i></b>Any creature that enters the area of the fire for the first time on its turn, or that starts its turn there, takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.</p><p><b><i>What Hulil Knows. </i></b>If the characters convince Hulil that they are her allies, or if they capture her or Raegrin and succeed on a DC 14 Charisma (Intimidation) check, they can learn the following information:</p><ul><li>Hulil believes she has a disease called frigid woe. Though she doesn’t know any more about the disease than its symptoms, she’s heard rumors that explorers in <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Lz3YR6-0plhW8NgxQ3J\">Eiselcross</a> sometimes succumb to it.</li><li>Hulil has guessed that her affliction was caused by one of the blue vials Tulgi stole from Pelc’s Curiosities, originally sold by Urgon Wenth. The vial was cracked, revealing that its lovely color was the result of a dark blue dust clinging to the interior.</li><li>She is desperate to get to <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Lz3ZTZNCnX_le67CBfn\">Shadycreek Run</a> before the malady runs its course, hoping that she can trade the goods stolen by Tulgi for a cure.</li></ul><p>Hulil used one of the vials to trap the chest containing the other stolen items (see “Stone Chest” below). Needing quick cash for the trip, she sold the other vial to Irven Liel, a human merchant staying at the Jolly Dwarf inn in <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Lz3Zsa4tDIuBs1eT8Ww\">Palebank Village</a> while traveling with his family to Uthodurn.</p><p><b><i>Stone Chest.</i></b> The stone chest’s outer lid is carved with the face of a dragon. A character who examines the chest and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check finds pin-sized openings in the dragon’s mouth that contain a blue powder. The powder can be removed with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. A character who fails this check must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract frigid woe (see <a href=\"http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Lz3YR6-0plhW8NgxQ3J\">Eiselcross</a>).</p><p>A <i><a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:Detect%20Magic\">detect magic</a></i> spell reveals that the chest radiates an aura of evocation magic. When a creature touches the chest without speaking a prayer to Tiamat, a gust of wind escapes the dragon’s mouth. If the blue powder is still in the dragon’s mouth, it forms a cloud that fills a 15-foot cube in front of the chest. Each creature within the area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract frigid woe.</p><p><b><i>Treasure.</i></b> The chest contains the rest of the treasure found by Urgon Wenth—a gilded scroll case covered in a cosmological map of the multiverse (worth 15 gp), a jade statuette of a storm giant (25 gp), a quiver containing six <i>+1 arrows</i>, and a silver ring set with a jasper stone (50 gp). It also holds Hulil’s wealth—415 cp, 234 sp, 43 ep, and 112 gp—and a receipt indicating that Hulil sold a blue glass vial to Irven Liel for 100 gp.</p><hr><h4>Development</h4><p>When the characters are done exploring Croaker Cave, they should know the blue glass vials found by Urgon Wenth are the source of the strange malady that is turning people into ice statues, and that Irven Liel has one of those vials. If the characters don’t have a chance to question Hulil or Raegrin, you can have the chest also contain a journal or notes that provide the information they need and point them toward the Jolly Dwarf inn.</p>"
